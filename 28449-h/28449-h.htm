<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>A SPARK PUTS THREE BOYS AND A BOAT ON THE JUMP</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Ho, ho, ho&mdash;hum!&#8221; grumbled Hank
Butts, vainly trying to stifle a prodigious
yawn. &#8220;This may be what
Mr. Seaton calls a vacation on full pay, but I&#8217;d
rather work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> fearfully dull, loafing around, in this
fashion, on a lonely island, yet in plain sight of
the sea that we long to rove over,&#8221; nodded Captain
Tom Halstead of the motor yacht &#8220;Restless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet Hank just put us in mind of the fact
that we&#8217;re getting paid for our time,&#8221; laughed
Joe Dawson, the least restless of the trio of
young Motor Boat Club boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh it&#8217;s all right on the pay end,&#8221; agreed
Hank, readily. &#8220;But just think of a young fellow,
full of life and hope, with a dozen ambitions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
and a hustling nature, taking up with a
job of this kind!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of job?&#8221; inquired Captain Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;The job of being bored,&#8221; answered Butts,
solemnly. &#8220;I could have had that kind of job
back on Long Island.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Without the pay,&#8221; amended Joe Dawson,
with another quiet smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;But ten days of being bored <i>does</i> grow
rather wearisome, even with the pay for a
solace,&#8221; agreed Tom Halstead.</p>
<p>Ting-ling-ling! The soft jangling of a bell
from one of the rooms of the seashore bungalow,
on the porch of which the boys sat, broke
in on them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah, Joe! Hustle and get that message,&#8221;
begged Hank, almost sitting up straight
in the porch chair, with a comical pretense of
excitement. &#8220;It&#8217;s sure to be from Mr. Seaton
this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Likely,&#8221; grinned Joe, as he rose and crossed
the porch in leisurely fashion. The jangling of
the bell continued. The bell was a rather
clumsy, yet sufficing device that young Dawson
had attached to the wireless telegraph apparatus.</p>
<p>For, though this bungalow on a little island
southwest of Beaufort, North Carolina, had an
appearance of being wholly out of the world,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
yet the absent owner, Mr. Powell Seaton, had
contrived to put his place very much &#8220;in the
world&#8221; by installing wireless telegraphy at the
bungalow. On the premises was operated a
complete electrical plant that furnished energy
enough to send messages for hundreds of miles
along the coast.</p>
<p>For Joe, the mechanical genius of the Motor
Boat Club, had always had a passion for telegraphy.
Of late he had gone in in earnest for
the wireless kind, and had rapidly mastered
its most essential details.</p>
<p>The bell told when electrical waves were rushing
through the air at marvelous speed, though
it did not distinguish between any general wave
and the special call for this bungalow station,
which was by the letters &#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>CBA</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Joe Dawson went into the room under
the tall aerials that hung from the mast, he expected
to listen only to some message not in the
least intended for this station.</p>
<p>Seating himself by the relay, with its Morse
register close at hand, Joe Dawson picked up
and adjusted the head-band with its pair of
watch-case receivers. He then hastily picked
up a pencil, shoved a pad of paper close under
his hand and listened.</p>
<p>All this he did with a dull, listless air. He
had not the slightest forewarning of the great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
jolt that was soon to come to himself and his
comrades out of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The call, whatever it was, had ended. Yet,
after a pause of a few seconds, it began to
sound again. Joe&#8217;s listless air vanished as the
new set of dots and dashes came in, clamoring
in clicking haste against his ear drums.</p>
<p>&#8220;To Every Wireless Station&mdash;Urgent!&#8221; ran
the first few words. Joe&#8217;s nimble fingers pushed
his pencil, recording letter after letter until
these words were down. Then, dropping his
pencil for the sending key, young Dawson transmitted
a crashing electric impulse into the air,
flashing through space over hundreds of miles
the station signal, &#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>CBA</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you a fast, seaworthy boat within immediate
call?&#8221; came back out of the invisible
distance over the ocean.</p>
<p>&#8220;A twenty-six-mile sea-going motor boat
right at the pier here,&#8221; Joe flashed back, again
adding his signature, &#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>CBA</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; came back the answer. &#8220;Then
listen hard&mdash;act quick&mdash;life at stake!&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe Dawson not only listened. His thoughts
flew with the dots and dashes of the wireless
message; his right hand rushed the pencil in
recording all of that wonderful message as it
came to him. It was tragedy that Dawson wrote
down at the dictation of this impatient operator
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
far out on the Atlantic highways. Almost in the
midst of it came a feverish break-in from land,
and another hand was playing in the great game
of life and death, fame and dishonor, riches
and intrigue. All was being unfolded by
means of the unseen, far-reaching wireless
telegraph.</p>
<p>As Joe listened, wrote, and occasionally broke
in to send a few words, the dew of cold perspiration
stood out on his brow. His fingers
trembled. With a great effort of the will this
motor boat boy steadied his nerves and muscles
in order to see through to the end this mysterious
thing coming out of space.</p>
<p>While this was going on, Joe Dawson did not
call out to either of his comrades. With an
instinct that worked as fast as the wireless messages
themselves, young Dawson chose to put
off calling the other motor boat boys until he
had the whole startling tale to tell them&mdash;until
he had in complete form the coming orders that
would send all three of them and the &#8220;Restless&#8221;
on a tireless sea-chase.</p>
<p>While this flood of dots and dashes is coming
in from seaward, and from landward, it is well
that the reader be put in possession of some information
that will make clearer to him the nature
of the dramatic events that followed this
sudden in-pouring of wireless messages to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
little &#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>CBA</span>&#8221; bungalow station on this island
off the North Carolina coast.</p>
<p>Readers of the preceding volume of this series,
&#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>The Motor Boat Club Off Long Island</span>,&#8221;
will at once recall that story, throbbing with
the interest of human life&mdash;will remember how
faithfully and wisely Tom Halstead, Joe Dawson
and Hank Butts, all members of the Motor
Boat Club, served that leader in Wall Street
finance, Francis Delavan, and the latter&#8217;s nervous,
wavering friend, Eben Moddridge. To
such former readers the tale is familiar of how
the Motor Boat Club boys aided materially in
frustrating a great conspiracy in finance, aimed
against their employer. Saved from ruin by
the grit, keenness and loyalty of these three
members of the Motor Boat Club, Messrs. Delavan
and Moddridge had handsomely rewarded
the boys for their signal services.</p>
<p>As Hank Butts preferred, for family reasons,
to spend his summers, and much of his other
time, on Long Island, he had been presented
with a thirty-foot launch, a shore lot at East
Hampton, and a &#8220;shack&#8221; and pier. Tom Halstead
and Joe Dawson, fast friends and both
from the same little Kennebec River village,
preferring always the broad ocean, had been
made the owners of the &#8220;Soudan,&#8221; a fine, sea-going,
fifty-five foot motor cruising yacht built
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
for deep sea work. Though the &#8220;Soudan&#8221; had
a very comfortable beam of fifteen feet, she was
nevertheless equipped with twin gasoline motors
that could send her over the waters at some
twenty-five or twenty-six miles an hour.</p>
<p>With the gift of the boat to Tom and Joe came
also a present of money enough to make the two
new young owners able to put her in commission
and keep her going for awhile.</p>
<p>It was not intended by Messrs. Delavan and
Moddridge that Tom Halstead and Joe Dawson
should be able to keep their new prize and property
running for their own pleasure. On the
contrary the givers of this splendid present believed
that the two boys would ply under charter
for wealthy pleasure seekers, thus making a
splendid living. In summer there were the
northern waters; in winter the southern waters.
Thus it was believed that Captain Tom Halstead
and Engineer Joe Dawson would be in a position
to earn a handsome income from their boat
the year around. At any time, should they so
choose, they could sell the boat.</p>
<p>Sell her? It would almost have broken honest,
impulsive, loyal Tom Halstead&#8217;s heart to
sell this precious boat! Joe Dawson, quiet
though he was, would have flown into a rage at
any suggestion of his parting with his interest
in the handsome, capable little craft!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>The owners had re-christened the boat the
&#8220;Restless.&#8221; Within ten days after the boys
had left the employ of Mr. Delavan, Captain
Tom had encountered Mr. Powell Seaton in New
York. A few hours after that meeting the boys
had had their boat chartered for at least the
month of September. Then, after receiving
their orders, they proceeded south to their present
location on Lonely Island, five miles off the
mainland. They were accompanied by Hank
Butts, who had left his small boat in other hands
and accepted temporary employment on the
&#8220;Restless.&#8221;</p>
<p>The island possessed an area of about half a
square mile. The bungalow itself, a shed that
was used as an electric power station, and a
third building that contained a telescope and
some other astronomical apparatus were the
sole interesting features of this island.</p>
<p>After the chartering, and the payment of half
the hire-money in advance for the month, not
one of these Motor Boat Club boys had laid eyes
on Mr. Powell Seaton. After cruising down
from New York, and taking possession of the
bungalow, as ordered, they had remained there
ten whole days, idle and wondering. Idle, that
is, except for running the electric power plant
as much as was needed, making their own beds
and doing their own cooking.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>For what purpose had Powell Seaton wanted
them and the &#8220;Restless&#8221;? Now, as Dawson&#8217;s
active fingers pushed the pencil through the
mazes of recorded messages, that active-minded
young man began to get a glimpse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds like something big, Joe,&#8221; smiled
Captain Tom, his eyes twinkling under the visor
of his uniform cap as he thrust his head in
through the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; muttered Joe, in a low but tense
voice. &#8220;Just wait. I&#8217;ve got one to send.&#8221;</p>
<p>His fingers moved busily at the key for a little
while. Then, snatching up the sheets of
paper on which he had written, Joe Dawson
leaped to his feet in such haste that he sent the
chair spinning across the room.</p>
<p>Such impulsiveness in Dawson was so utterly
unusual that Captain Tom Halstead gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; called Joe, darting to the door.
&#8220;Down to the boat!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8211;&#8211;?&#8221; began Tom Halstead, but he
got only as far as that word, for Joe shot back:</p>
<p>&#8220;To sea!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; again essayed Halstead.</p>
<p>&#8220;At full speed&mdash;the fastest we can travel!&#8221;
called back Joe, who was leaping down the porch
steps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any time to lock up?&#8221; demanded Tom, half-laughingly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;but hustle! I&#8217;ll get the motor started
and be waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hank Butts was leaning indolently against
one of the porch posts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at old Joe sailing before a fair wind,&#8221;
he laughed, admiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn to, Hank! Help lock the windows and
the doors&mdash;full speed ahead!&#8221; directed Captain
Tom, with vigor. &#8220;Joe Dawson never goes
off at racing speed like that unless he has his
orders and knows what he&#8217;s doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were the captain,&#8221; grinned
Hank, as he sprang to obey.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I am,&#8221; Halstead shot at the other boy.
&#8220;But, just as it happens, Joe has the sailing
orders&mdash;and he can be trusted with &#8217;em. Now&mdash;everything
is tight and the keys in my pocket.
For the dock, on the run!&#8221;</p>
<p>Chug-chug! Joe had surely been moving, for,
by the time the other boys reached the dock,
Dawson had the hatchway of the motor room
open and the twin motors had begun to move.
The young engineer, an oil-can in hand, was
watching the revolutions of the two handsome
machines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand by the stern-line to throw off, Hank,&#8221;
called Captain Tom, as he raced out onto the
dock and made a plunge for the bow hawser.
With this in hand he sprang aboard.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How soon, Joe?&#8221; called the young skipper,
throwing the canvas cover from the wheel down
onto the bridge deck.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as you like,&#8221; was Joe&#8217;s answer, as
he threw more speed into the twin motors.</p>
<p>Hank had the stern hawser in his hands by
this time. Halstead threw the wheel over
slightly, warping the boat&#8217;s graceful bow away
from the dock under just a touch of speed ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come aboard, Hank!&#8221; called the young
skipper. As soon as Butts had obeyed with a
flying leap, Tom rang for half speed ahead,
moving smoothly out of the little sand-bound
harbor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coil the hawsers, Hank,&#8221; directed the young
skipper. &#8220;Put the wheel cover away. Then relieve
Joe. I want to hear from him.&#8221;</p>
<p>These three separate orders Hank had executed
within less than two minutes, and jumped
down into the motor room. Joe came on deck,
holding the sheets of paper in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, let&#8217;s understand what the business is,
anyway,&#8221; suggested Tom Halstead. &#8220;Who
signaled us? Mr. Seaton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but he wasn&#8217;t the first one,&#8221; Dawson
answered. &#8220;The first hail came from out of the
sea, from the Black B liner, &#8216;Constant,&#8217; addressed
to any wireless station and tagged
&#8216;urgent.&#8217; Here it is.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>One hand on the wheel, the young skipper received
the sheet held out to him. It read:</p>
<p style='font-size:0.9em; margin: 0.5em 2em'>
Can you send fast boat instantly to take off badly injured
passenger for medical treatment? Passenger A. B. Clodis,
believed to be wealthy man from New York, discovered unconscious,
perhaps dying, from fall. Fractured skull.
Believe passenger or family to be able to pay handsomely
for services.</p>

<p style='text-align:right; font-size:smaller; margin-right: 2em'>
(Signed) <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Hampton</span>, <i>captain</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s another sheet giving the ship&#8217;s position
at that moment,&#8221; Joe continued; &#8220;also her
course and speed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you answered?&#8221; demanded Halstead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as I started to, the wireless at Beaufort
broke in. It seems that Mr. Seaton is at Beaufort,
and that he heard, at once, of the trouble.
Here is Mr. Seaton&#8217;s order.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe Dawson held out another sheet, on which
he had transcribed this wireless message:</p>
<p style='font-size:0.9em; margin: 0.5em 2em'>
Halstead, Lonely Island: Clodis is my man on important
matter. Get him off ship, and with all speed. Take him
to Lonely Island, where I will arrive with surgeons and
nurses. Get all his baggage and papers off with him, and
take greatest care of same. Whole thing plotted by enemies.
If they succeed it spells ruin for me and more than one
tragedy. I depend on you boys; don&#8217;t fail me! Act at
full speed.</p>

<p style='text-align:right; font-size:smaller; margin-right: 2em'>
(Signed) <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Powell Seaton.</span></p>

<p style='text-align:left; font-size:smaller; margin-left: 2em'>
P. XXX S.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That comes from Mr. Seaton, all right,&#8221;
nodded Captain Tom. &#8220;That&#8217;s his private signal,
below his name, that he told us to look for
on all orders of his. Now, let me have a look
again at the position and course of the &#8216;Constant.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>After studying the dispatch intently, Captain
Halstead nodded to his chum to take the wheel.
Facing about, Tom swung open the small chart-case
secured to the top of the deck-house. With
a small, accurate pocket rule he made some
measurements.</p>
<p>&#8220;At twenty-five miles an hour, Joe, if you
can keep it up, a straight sou&#8217;east by east
course should bring us right in the path of
the &#8216;Constant&#8217; on the course and speed she
reports.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we can keep the speed up,&#8221; predicted
Joe, confidently. &#8220;But I can&#8217;t fool with the engine,
unless you insist. I ought to be back in
the cabin, at the wireless instrument.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hank can keep at the motors, then,&#8221; nodded
Captain Tom. &#8220;Go along, old fellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe paused but an instant to give Hank the
needed orders, then raced aft. At the after end
of the cabin were two snug little staterooms; at
the other end, forward, a table had been fitted
up with wireless apparatus, for the twin motors
of the boat generated, by means of a dynamo,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
electricity enough for a very respectable wireless
spark.</p>
<p>Hardly had Joe vanished when Hank, satisfied
with the performance of the motors, appeared
on deck. The signal mast stood just
behind the bridge deck. It was of light, hollow
steel, with two inner tubes that, when extended,
made an unusually high mast for such a boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can run the extension mast up to full
height in this light breeze, can&#8217;t we, Tom?&#8221;
asked the Long Island boy. Halstead nodded.</p>
<p>So simple was the arrangement that, within
a few moments, Hank had the aerials well
aloft. Nor was he too soon, for this query came
promptly through space from Powell Seaton, up
at Beaufort:</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you starting at once?&#8221;</p>
<p>With a quiet grin, all alone there by the wireless
apparatus, young Dawson sparked back
through the air:</p>
<p>&#8220;Three miles east, and running to intercept
the &#8216;Constant.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; came clicking into Joe Dawson&#8217;s
watch-case receivers against his ears, a moment
later. &#8220;Then I won&#8217;t bother you further. I
trust you. But, oh, if you should fail! You
don&#8217;t know what failure means&mdash;to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>All this, of course, was clicked out in the dot
and dash code of the Morse alphabet, but to Joe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
Dawson it was as plain as words spoken by the
human voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Mr. Seaton.&#8221; Joe&#8217;s busy
right hand fingers clicked out the message on
the sending key, while the electric waves sped
from the aerials aloft outside. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know
what &#8216;failure&#8217; means. We won&#8217;t fail you.
Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Joe turned his attention to the &#8220;Constant.&#8221;
The big Black B liner answered
promptly. She was on the same course, and
glad to know that the &#8220;Restless&#8221; was speeding
over the sea to seek her.</p>
<p>Having finished in raising the extended signal
mast, and glancing into the motor room to see
that the motors were running smoothly, Hank
leaned against the raised deck top. The Long
Island boy was hardly to be expected as a member
of the crew of the &#8220;Restless&#8221; on this cruise,
but he had wound up the summer season at East
Hampton, and now, with idle September coming
upon him, he had found the longing for the
broad sea too powerful for him. Family conditions
at home being satisfactory, he had promised
himself this one month away from home,
and was aboard as steward and general helper.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if our work for Mr. Seaton has
started in earnest?&#8221; ventured Hank.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has, for a few hours to-day, anyway,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
smiled Captain Tom. &#8220;We&#8217;re cruising at full
speed, and under orders from the man who
chartered the &#8216;Restless&#8217; for this month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But who can this Clodis be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Tom Halstead admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder why Mr. Seaton is so mightily interested
in him? What does Seaton mean by
hinting at ruin and tragedies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what I think, Hank?&#8221; queried
the young skipper, quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it would be downright impudence on
our part to get too inquisitive about the affairs
of the man who employs us. We looked Mr.
Seaton up, and found he had the reputation of
being an honest man. That&#8217;s as much of
his business as we have any right to want to
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hank colored, though he went on, in an argumentative
way:</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose that&#8217;s all true enough, Tom. Still,
it&#8217;s human nature, when you smell a big mystery,
to want to know the meaning of at least
some of it. And I&#8217;m mighty curious, because I
scent something unusually big in the air.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; admitted the young skipper, giving
the wheel another turn in order to hold the
fast-moving boat to her course.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on, Hank! Don&#8217;t be downright nosey.
And, as for guessing&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Seaton as good as hints that there&#8217;s
been a downright attempt to kill this man Clodis,&#8221;
broke in Hank, who could not be repressed
easily. &#8220;And Seaton is surely mightily worked
up about it. And sending us out to take a passenger
off a steamer bound for South America!
Tom, do you s&#8217;pose that criminals are&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hank,&#8221; broke in the young skipper, half-severely,
&#8220;there&#8217;s something squeaking on one
of the motors. For goodness&#8217; sake don&#8217;t let us
break down on what we&#8217;ve been told is a life-and-death
trip! Get below and see what&#8217;s
wrong. Stand by to watch the performance of
the motors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hank vanished, inwardly grumbling, for his
curiosity was doing two hours&#8217; work every
minute.</p>
<p>Captain Tom, after measuring on the chart,
had figured on meeting the &#8220;Constant&#8221; in two
hours and twenty minutes. Now, at every turn
of the twin shafts the young skipper&#8217;s blood
bounded with the desire to do his full duty in
arriving on time. Yet there was not wanting
pleasure, mixed with the anxiety. How good
the fresh, salty air tasted, out here on the broad
sea, with the low coast-line already nearly out
of sight! Tom Halstead sniffed in breath after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
breath. His eyes danced as they beheld the
spraying of white water cut and turned up by
the boat&#8217;s fast prow. Oh, it was great to be out
here on the deep, one hand guiding the course
of one of the nimblest yachts afloat!</p>
<p>Joe, as he came forward, felt this same wild
exhilaration. Quiet, dutiful and law-abiding as
both these Motor Boat Club boys were, there
must have been much of the old Norseman Viking
blood in their veins, for this swift dash over
the rolling swell of the ocean was like a tonic
to them both.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, isn&#8217;t it all grand?&#8221; demanded Joe, his
cheeks glowing, as he paused on the bridge deck,
taking in great whiffs of the purest air supplied
to man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great!&#8221; admitted Skipper Tom, in a tone
that was almost a cheer. Then he asked,
gravely:</p>
<p>&#8220;Any news?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Seaton knows we have started, and expresses
his pleasure. I&#8217;ve signaled the &#8216;Constant,&#8217;
and she&#8217;s still keeping to the same course,
and will so continue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the patient, Clodis?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still alive, Tom; but the ship&#8217;s surgeon offers
no hope, and will be glad to have us take
him onto the &#8216;Restless.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be something terrible to make Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
Seaton so anxious about the man,&#8221; observed
Tom, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded Joe. Then: &#8220;Say, Tom, I&#8217;ve
just struck an easy scheme for connecting one
of the armatures of the Morse register, aft, to
a buzzer in the engine room. Then if I happen
to be in the engine room when wireless messages
are traveling through the air I shall
know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the next hour all three of the boys, though
they did not talk much about it, were wondering
about this tragedy of the deep sea that had
called them into action. Though they could not
as yet guess it, this present affair of theirs was
but the start of a series of adventures more
amazing than any they had ever dreamed of.
Now, at the most, they were curious. Soon they
were to know what it meant to be astounded;
they were soon to know what it felt like to feel
haunted, to find themselves assailed by dread
after dread. Undoubtedly it was merciful for
them that they could not, at this moment, peer
behind the curtain of the immediate future.</p>
<p>So, ignorant of what fate and destiny held in
store for them, they were mainly intent, now,
upon intercepting at the right point the big liner
cruising swiftly southward.</p>
<p>In another hour they made out smoke on the
horizon where Skipper Tom judged the &#8220;Constant&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
to be. Later the spars of the steamship
were visible through the marine glasses. Then
the hull appeared. A few minutes later Captain
Tom ran the &#8220;Restless&#8221; dashingly in
alongside the great black hull of the liner, along
whose starboard rail a hundred or more passengers
had gathered.</p>
<p>Turning the wheel over to Hank, Captain
Tom Halstead snatched up the megaphone as
the larger vessel slowed down.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Constant,&#8217; ahoy!&#8221; bellowed the young
skipper. &#8220;This is the yacht &#8216;Restless,&#8217; sent to
receive your injured passenger, Clodis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Restless&#8217; ahoy!&#8221; came the response from
the liner&#8217;s bridge. &#8220;We&#8217;ll lower our starboard
side gangway, if you can come alongside
safely.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Motor Boat Club boys were at the threshold
of their strangest, wildest succession of adventures!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>SOME OF THE MYSTERY UNRAVELED</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;IF we can come alongside safely,&#8221; echoed
Hank, disgustedly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show &#8217;em&mdash;and
in a smooth swell of sea like this, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>As the big steamship lay to, Hank steered in
until Captain Tom, boathook in hand, made fast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
temporarily. Then Hank hurried up with a line
with which he took a fast hitch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, there, you&#8217;ll pull away our side gangway,&#8221;
roared down a mate, whose head and uniform
cap showed over the rail above.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know us,&#8221; grinned Joe Dawson,
quietly.</p>
<p>By this time Tom Halstead was running
lightly up the steps of the gangway. He reached
the small platform above, then passed to the
deck.</p>
<p>He was met by Captain Hampton, who inquired:</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your sailing master, young man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right before you, Captain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are your owners?&#8221; demanded Captain
Hampton, much astonished by Tom&#8217;s quiet assurance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m captain and half-owner of the &#8216;Restless,&#8217;
sir,&#8221; Halstead continued, still smiling at
the other captain&#8217;s very evident astonishment.
&#8220;The other owner is the engineer, Joe Dawson,
my chum.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Hampton swallowed something very
hard. Several of the passengers were smiling.
A man who has followed the sea for years knows
the capacity and efficiency that boys often display
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
on shipboard, but it is unusual to find a
boy acting as master of a yacht.</p>
<p>However, there was the &#8220;Restless,&#8221; and there
was Tom Halstead in the captain&#8217;s uniform.
These were facts that could not be disputed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a passenger, a Mr. Clodis, that
you want to have me take off?&#8221; resumed Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; you have come for him, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only that, but Mr. Seaton, the gentleman
who has our boat in charter, has very urgently
ordered us to bring Mr. Clodis ashore; also his
baggage complete, and any and all papers that
he may have brought aboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a comfortable berth on your
boat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Several of them,&#8221; Tom answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll have some of my men make the
transfer at once. Our ship&#8217;s surgeon, Dr. Burke,
will also go over the side and see that Mr. Clodis
is made as comfortable as possible for his
trip ashore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Steward Butts will show your men to the
port stateroom, aft, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>A mate hurried away to give the order to Dr.
Burke. A boatswain was directed to attend to
having all of Mr. Clodis&#8217;s baggage go over the
side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to my stateroom, sir, if you please,&#8221;
requested Captain Hampton, and Tom followed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When you take a man with a fractured skull
ashore, the authorities may want some explanation,&#8221;
declared the &#8216;Constant&#8217;s&#8217; sailing master,
opening his desk. &#8220;Here is a statement, therefore,
that I have prepared and signed. Take it
with you, Captain&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Halstead,&#8221; supplied Tom.</p>
<p>The motor boat boy glanced hurriedly through
the document.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you state it was an accident, Captain
Hampton,&#8221; went on Halstead, lowering his
voice. &#8220;Our charter-man, Mr. Seaton, intimated
that he believed it might have been a deliberate
assault. Have you anything that you
wish to say on this point, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it was an assault,&#8221; replied
the ship&#8217;s master, musingly. Halstead&#8217;s quick
eye noted that Hampton appeared to be a
sturdy, honest sea-dog. &#8220;Still, Captain Halstead,
if you would like to question the steward
who found Mr. Clodis at the foot of the main
saloon companionway&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you made the investigation thoroughly,
sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so&mdash;yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then nothing is likely to be gained, Captain,
by my asking any questions of a steward
you have already questioned.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mate came back to report that Mr. Clodis
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
had been carried over the side, and that his
baggage had been taken aboard the &#8220;Restless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you don&#8217;t want a liner held up,&#8221;
Tom went on, slipping Captain Hampton&#8217;s report
of the accident into his pocket. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go
over the side, sir, as soon as you can ascertain
whether Mr. Clodis had any papers that ought
to be sent ashore with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are none in the injured man&#8217;s pockets,&#8221;
replied the steamship&#8217;s sailing master,
&#8220;and none were deposited with the purser. So,
if there are any papers, they must be in Mr.
Clodis&#8217;s trunk or bag.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir. Then I&#8217;ll bid you good-bye
and hurry over the side,&#8221; said Halstead, energetically.</p>
<p>As they stepped out of the stateroom a passenger
who had been lingering near stepped up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, one moment,&#8221; said Captain Hampton,
suddenly. &#8220;Captain Halstead, this gentleman
is Mr. Arthur Hilton. Since leaving New York
he has received some wireless news that makes
him anxious to return. He wants to go ashore
with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arthur Hilton had stepped forward, holding
out his hand, which Tom took in his own. Mr.
Hilton was a man of about thirty, smooth-faced,
with firm set jaws. Though evidently not a
Spaniard, he had the complexion usual to that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
race. His dark eyes were keen and sharp,
though they had a rather pleasant look in them.
He was slender, perhaps five feet eight inches
tall, and, although his waist and legs were thin,
he had broad, rather powerful looking shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can set me ashore, can&#8217;t you, young
man, for a ten-dollar bill?&#8221; inquired Hilton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, if Captain Hampton knows no
reason why you shouldn&#8217;t leave the vessel,&#8221;
Tom answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Hilton has surrendered his passage
ticket, and there is nothing to detain him
aboard,&#8221; replied the steamship&#8217;s master.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your baggage ready, sir?&#8221; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing but this bag,&#8221; laughed Hilton,
stepping back and picking up his hand luggage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along, then, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Tom Halstead pressed his way through the
throng of passengers gathered on deck, he heard
several wondering, and some admiring, remarks
relative to the youthfulness of the skipper of so
handsome and trim a yacht.</p>
<p>Hilton followed the young skipper down over
the side. Tom turned to help him to the deck of
the &#8220;Restless,&#8221; but Hilton lightly leaped across,
holding his bag before him. Tom Halstead, as
he turned, got a good look at that bag. It was
one that he was likely to remember for many a
day. The article was of dark red leather, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
on one side the surface for a space as large as
a man&#8217;s hand had been torn away, probably in
some accident.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the passage money, Captain,&#8221; said
Hilton, passing over a ten-dollar bill. Murmuring
his thanks, the young skipper crumpled up
the bill, shoving it into a trousers pocket, then
hurried aft.</p>
<p>Clodis was a short, almost undersized man of
perhaps forty-five, stout and well dressed. His
head was so bandaged, as he lay in the lower
berth of the port stateroom, that not much of
his face was visible.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s unconscious, and probably will be for
hours,&#8221; stated Dr. Burke, as Captain Tom appeared
in the doorway. &#8220;If he comes to, I&#8217;ve
left some medicine with your steward, to be
given the patient. Of course you&#8217;ll get him
ashore and under medical care as promptly as
possible, Captain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surgeons are on the way from Beaufort to
meet us,&#8221; the young skipper nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll return to my ship,&#8221; declared Dr.
Burke, rising. &#8220;But I&#8217;m glad to know that
Mr. Clodis is going to be met by a friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the doctor hurried over the side, Hilton
turned to walk aft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay forward, if you please, sir,&#8221; interposed
Captain Tom. &#8220;No one is to go into the cabin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
until the patient has been removed under a
doctor&#8217;s orders.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a frown on Hilton&#8217;s face, which,
however, almost instantly vanished. Joe
brought a deck arm chair and placed it for Mr.
Hilton on the bridge deck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good luck for you and your patient, sir,&#8221;
called down Captain Hampton over the rail, as
he prepared to get under headway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; Tom acknowledged.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll take the best care of Mr. Clodis that we
know how.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Hank on duty in the cabin, Tom Halstead
had to cast off and make his own start
as best he could. He managed the double task
neatly, however, and, as he fell away the &#8220;Constant&#8217;s&#8221;
engine-room bell could be heard for
half-speed-ahead.</p>
<p>The little auto-whistle of the &#8220;Restless&#8221;
sounded shrilly, to be answered with a long,
deep-throated blast from the liner&#8217;s steam
whistle. With this brief interchange of sea
courtesies the two craft fell apart, going on their
respective ways.</p>
<p>&#8220;Full speed on the return?&#8221; called Joe, from
the doorway of the motor room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded Captain Tom. &#8220;But look out
for vibration. Our sick man has had his skull
cracked.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>By the time the yacht had gone scooting for
more than a mile over the waves, Captain Halstead,
left hand on the wheel, turned to Hilton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear how our sick man came to be
hurt, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t hear of it until a couple of hours
after it happened,&#8221; replied Hilton. &#8220;I understand
that Mr. Clodis fell down the stairs leading
to the main saloon, and was picked up unconscious.
That was about all the word that
was given out on board.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Tom nodded, then gave his whole attention
to making Lonely Island as speedily as
possible. There was no land in sight, and the
trip back was a long one. Yet the young skipper
had his bearings perfectly.</p>
<p>They were still some eight miles off Lonely
Island when Hilton roused himself at sight of
a low-hulled, black schooner scudding north under
a big spread of canvas.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to pass close to that boat,
aren&#8217;t you, Captain?&#8221; asked the bridge deck
passenger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; pretty close.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As I understand it, you&#8217;re going to land at
an island some miles off the coast, whereas I
wish to reach the mainland at the earliest possible
moment, and catch a railway train. So,
Captain, if you&#8217;ll signal that schooner and put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
me aboard, I shall feel under sufficient obligation
to hand you another ten-dollar bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>That looked so much like earning money
rapidly that Halstead called Joe up from the
motor room to set the signal. The schooner lay
to until overtaken. Hilton discovered that the
schooner was bound for Beaufort, and the bargain
was quickly completed. A small boat put
off from the sailing vessel and the bridge deck
passenger, his noticeable bag included, was
transferred.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Restless&#8221; was nearer Lonely Island,
and the schooner was hull down, when Captain
Tom suddenly started as Joe Dawson stepped
upon deck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blazes, Joe!&#8221; exclaimed the young skipper.
&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ve done it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid so, too,&#8221; came quietly from the
young engineer.</p>
<p>&#8220;That fellow Hilton, so anxious to get ashore,
may be the very chap who struck down Mr.
Clodis!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The thought had just come to me,&#8221; admitted
Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! You know, Mr. Seaton hinted that
the &#8216;accident&#8217; might have been an attempt to
kill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain and engineer of the &#8220;Restless&#8221;
stared disconcertedly at each other.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, why did I have to go and make such
a fearful stumble as that?&#8221; groaned Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t, any more than I did,&#8221; Joe tried
to console him.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should, at least, have kept Hilton aboard
until Mr. Seaton had had a chance to look him
over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could send a wireless to the Beaufort police
to grab Hilton on landing,&#8221; suggested Joe,
doubtfully, but Tom Halstead shook his head
energetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; the Beaufort police wouldn&#8217;t do that
on our say-so, Joe. And, even if they did, we
might get ourselves into a lot of trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Restless&#8221; kept smoothly, swiftly on her
way, bounding over the low, gentle swell of the
calm ocean. Tom shivered whenever he thought
of the possibility of the motors becoming cranky.
With such important human freight aboard any
mishap to the machinery would be extremely
serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe,&#8221; called Tom, at last, as the yacht came
in sight of Lonely Island, &#8220;there&#8217;s a tug at our
dock.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dawson came on deck, taking the marine glass
from his chum&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess Mr. Seaton has been hustling, then.
He couldn&#8217;t have come from Beaufort on the
tug, after all the trouble of rounding up doctors.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
He must have come down the shore in an
automobile, and then engaged the tug near the
island.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the &#8220;Restless&#8221; went closer, the tug, with
two short toots of its whistle, moved out from
the dock. Powell Seaton, in broad-brimmed hat
and blue serge, waved his hand vigorously at
the boys. With him stood three men, presumably
surgeons. Captain Tom Halstead sounded
three short blasts of the auto-whistle to signal
the success of his errand, while Joe swung his
uniform cap over his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get down to your engines, Joe,&#8221; called Captain
Tom. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to make a swift landing
that will be in keeping with Mr. Seaton&#8217;s impatience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Up to within nearly two hundred yards of
the dock the &#8220;Restless&#8221; dashed in at full speed.
Then signaling for half speed, next for the stop,
and finally for the reverse, Captain Tom swung
the yacht in almost a semi-circle, running up
with bare headway so that the boat lay in gently
against the string-piece. In that instant Tom,
leaving the wheel, bounded up onto the dock,
bow hawser in hand, and made the loop fast
over the snubbing post. In the same instant Joe
Dawson, cat-footed, raced aft, next leaping
ashore with the stern hawser.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jove, but that was a beautiful bit of boat-handling&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
superb piece of seamanship!&#8221; muttered
one of the surgeons, admiringly.</p>
<p>Powell Seaton, however, stopped to hear
none of this. He gripped Tom by the arm, demanding
hoarsely:</p>
<p>&#8220;You brought Clodis ashore? How is he?
Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still unconscious, sir, and the ship&#8217;s doctor
offered no hope. You will find your friend in
the port stateroom, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Signing to the surgeons to accompany him,
Mr. Seaton vanished aft, the medical men with
him. Ten minutes passed before Hank came
up, alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do the doctors say, Hank?&#8221; demanded
Tom, instantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;One chance in about a million,&#8221; replied
Hank, in a very subdued voice&mdash;for him.</p>
<p>Five minutes later Mr. Seaton, hat in hand,
also came up on deck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Seaton,&#8221; murmured Tom, eagerly,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting for you. I&mdash;we&#8217;ve something
to tell you.&#8221; Then the young skipper detailed
the affair of taking Arthur Hilton from
the &#8220;Constant&#8221; and transferring him to the
Beaufort-bound schooner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Describe the fellow!&#8221; commanded Powell
Seaton, suddenly, hoarsely.</p>
<p>Captain Tom did so.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Arthur Hilton he called himself, did he?&#8221;
cried Mr. Seaton, in a rage. &#8220;Anson Dalton is
the scoundrel&#8217;s real name!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he, sir?&#8221; Tom asked, anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Anson Dalton?&#8221; cried Mr. Seaton,
his voice sounding as though he were choking.
&#8220;Who, but the scoundrel who has engineered
this whole desperate plot against me! The
dastard who struck down Allan Clodis! The
knave who has striven for the badge of Cain!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>INVISIBLE HANDS AT THE WIRELESS</h3>
</div>
<p>In a rear bedroom, the furthest apartment
from the wireless room of the bungalow,
Allan Clodis, barely alive, was placed
when they bore him up from the boat. Then
the three surgeons, retaining only Hank Butts,
drove the others from the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back to the wireless!&#8221; breathed Seaton,
tensely. &#8220;Dawson, get Beaufort on the jump.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have the Beaufort operator,&#8221; reported
Joe, after a few moments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then rush this message, and ask the operator
to get it in the hands of the chief of police
without an instant&#8217;s loss of time,&#8221; directed Mr.
Seaton, speaking in jerky haste.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>The message described Anson Dalton, also the
black schooner on which he had last been seen.
The police chief was asked to arrest Dalton on
sight, on the authority of Powell Seaton, and
hold him for the United States authorities, for
an attempt at homicide on an American ship on
the high seas.</p>
<p>Within ten minutes back came the reply from
Beaufort to this effect:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have men out watching for the schooner.
Man Dalton will be arrested as you request.
Will notify you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried Mr. Seaton, rubbing his hands
vengefully. &#8220;Oh, Dalton, you scoundrel, you
can&#8217;t escape us now, for long! You knew that,
if you continued down the coast, there was
danger that a United States revenue cutter
would intercept the ship and take you off. At
best, you knew you would be arrested at Rio
Janeiro, if I suspected you, as I was bound to
do. So you tried to steal ashore here, to be
swallowed up in the mazes of this broad country
at least an hour or two ahead of pursuit. And,
but for the wireless spark that leaps through
space, you could have done so. But we shall
have you now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; began Tom Halstead, hintingly,
then paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless&mdash;what?&#8221; insisted Mr. Seaton.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose Dalton is shrewd enough to pay the
captain of the schooner to land him at some
other point, where there is neither a policeman
nor a telegraph station?&#8221;</p>
<p>Seaton made a noise that sounded as though
he were grinding his teeth. Then he picked up
a pencil, writing furiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Send this to the police chief at Beaufort,&#8221;
he ordered. Joe Dawson&#8217;s fingers made the
sending-key sing. The message was one warning
the police chief that Dalton might attempt
to land at some point outside of Beaufort, and
asking him to cover all near points along the
coast. Mr. Seaton offered to make good any
expense that this would entail.</p>
<p>Once more, in a few minutes, the answer was
at hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chief of police at Beaufort says,&#8221; Joe translated
the dots and dashes, &#8220;that his authority
does not extend beyond the city limits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Mr. Seaton began to show signs of
fury. Then, as though to force self-control, he
trod softly out of the room, going toward the
door of the sick-room, where Hank Butts stood
guard.</p>
<p>&#8220;No news, sir; no change,&#8221; Hank reported,
in an undertone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid Mr. Seaton is pretty angry with
us,&#8221; said Tom Halstead, gravely, &#8220;for allowing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
Hilton&mdash;Dalton, I mean&mdash;to get away from
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he may as well get over it,&#8221; commented
Joe Dawson, quietly. &#8220;We&#8217;re hired to
furnish a boat, to sail it, and, incidentally, to
run a wireless telegraph apparatus. We didn&#8217;t
engage ourselves as policemen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; nodded young Captain Halstead.
&#8220;Still, I might have done some quicker thinking.
My! What would Dalton have felt like if I had
run straight for this dock, refusing to put him
aboard any other craft?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had tried to do that,&#8221; retorted Joe,
with another quiet smile, &#8220;do you know, Tom,
what I think your friends would have been doing
and saying of you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; of course not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your friends would have been sending
flowers, and bringing tears. They would be looking
at you, to-morrow, and saying, in undertones:
&#8216;Goodness, how natural he looks!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Halstead was puzzled for a moment or two.
Then, comprehending, he grinned, though he demanded:</p>
<p>&#8220;You think Dalton would have dared anything
like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you notice what kind of a rascal Mr.
Seaton thinks Dalton is. And you know we
don&#8217;t go armed aboard the &#8216;Restless.&#8217; Now,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
I&#8217;m pretty certain that Dalton could have displayed
and used weapons if we had given him
any cause to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, when Powell Seaton entered
the room, he beheld Captain Tom Halstead
seated at the operator&#8217;s table, sealing an
envelope that he had just directed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing, Captain?&#8221; asked the
charter-man.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know that miserable twenty dollars that
I took from Anson Dalton for passage money?&#8221;
inquired Halstead, looking up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just enclosed the money in this envelope,
with a note.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to return the money to Dalton when
you find his address?&#8221; smiled Mr. Seaton,
wearily.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; retorted Tom, in a voice sharp
with disgust. &#8220;Dalton seems to have more
money, already, than is good for him. I&#8217;ve
addressed this envelope to a county institution
down in the state that I come from.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A public institution?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; the home for feeble-minded
youth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take it so hard as that, Halstead,&#8221;
urged Mr. Seaton. &#8220;Had you had a suspicion
you would have done whatever lay in your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
power. I might have warned you against Dalton,
but the truth is, <i>I</i> did not imagine he would
be right on the scene.&#8221;</p>
<p>Saying which, Powell Seaton walked away by
himself. He was gravely, even sadly preoccupied.
Though Captain Halstead could not
even guess what the underlying mystery was, he
knew that it seriously affected Mr. Seaton&#8217;s
plans and fortune. Their charter-man was
worried almost past endurance, though bravely
trying to hide the fact.</p>
<p>After the consultation of the surgeons, two of
them departed aboard the tug, the third remaining
to care for the patient. Hank, despite all
his bluntness of manner, was proving himself
valuable in the sick-room, while Joe spent most
of his time in the wireless room of the bungalow,
waiting to receive or send any word. So,
as evening came, Tom Halstead bestirred
himself with the preparation of the evening
meal.</p>
<p>By dark there was a considerable wind blowing.
Halstead left his cooking long enough to
run down and make sure that all was snug and
tight aboard the &#8220;Restless.&#8221; The young skipper
had fairly to fight his way against the wind
on his return to the bungalow.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s going to be a tough old gale to-night,&#8221;
Tom muttered to himself, as he halted,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
a moment, on the porch, to study the weather
conditions.</p>
<p>As yet, it was blowing only fairly hard. As
the little group at the bungalow seated themselves
at supper, however, the storm broke, with
a deluge of rain and a sharp roar of thunder.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will bother wireless conditions to-night,
won&#8217;t it?&#8221; queried Mr. Seaton, as they
ate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some, perhaps, if the gale and the storm
keep up,&#8221; replied Joe Dawson. &#8220;But I imagine
the worst of the gale is passing now.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so it proved. An hour later the rain was
falling steadily, though only in a drizzle. The
wind had moderated a good deal.</p>
<p>As all hands, save Hank, sat in the sitting
room of the bungalow, after the meal, the warning
bell from the apparatus room suddenly
tinkled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, sir,&#8221; said Joe, rising quickly, &#8220;the
wireless is still able to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>He passed into the next room, seating himself
by the instruments and slipping on the head-band
that held the receivers.</p>
<p>&#8220;From Beaufort, sir,&#8221; Joe said, presently,
looking up. &#8220;The police report that no such
schooner has landed at that city.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Acknowledge the message of the police,&#8221; directed
Mr. Seaton, &#8220;and ask them not to give up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
the lookout through the night. Tell the chief
of police that I&#8217;ll gladly meet any expense that
may be incurred.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe&#8217;s right hand reached out for the sending-key.
Then a blank look flashed across his
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something wrong with the sending-key connections,&#8221;
he explained, in a low voice, leaping
up. He examined the connections closely, yet,
the more he looked, the more puzzled he became.</p>
<p>&#8220;The storage batteries can&#8217;t have given out,&#8221;
he muttered, snatching up a lighted lantern.
&#8220;But I&#8217;ll go and look at them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Out into the little dynamo shed he darted,
followed by Powell Seaton and by Tom. The
doctor was dozing in an arm-chair.</p>
<p>Joe gave two or three swift looks at the
dynamo, the storage battery connections and
other parts of the apparatus. Then his face
went white with rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Mr. Seaton,&#8221; he panted,
hoarsely. &#8220;There&#8217;s been some infernal work
here&mdash;someone else has been on the island, for
none of our crowd would do such a trick! Not
even in fun! Look, sir, at where the parts have
been tampered with. Look where pliers have
been used to cut the wire connections. See
where these two bolts have been neatly removed
with the help of wrenches. Look at&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>Joe paused, then glanced wildly around.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221; he groaned. &#8220;Just the parts
removed that can&#8217;t be replaced. The whole
generating plant crippled! Mr. Seaton, until
we get in touch with the mainland, and get some
needed supplies there, we can&#8217;t use this wireless
plant again. We can receive messages&mdash;yes, up
to any limit, but not a word can we send away
from here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But who can have done this trick?&#8221; gasped
Powell Seaton, looking as though amazement
had numbed him, as, indeed, it almost had.</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone has landed here, since dark,&#8221;
broke in Tom Halstead, all a-quiver with dismay.
&#8220;While we were at supper some sneak or
sneaks have landed on this island. They have
pried their way in here, and they&#8217;ve crippled
our connection with the outside world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They could do it all easily enough, without
making any noise,&#8221; confirmed Joe. &#8220;Yes&mdash;they&#8217;ve
done a splendid job, from a scoundrel&#8217;s
point of view!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you can&#8217;t make this apparatus work
for the sending of even a single message?&#8221; demanded
Mr. Seaton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not until we&#8217;ve landed some necessary repair
and replacement materials from the mainland,&#8221;
replied Joe, with a disgusted shake of
his head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But you can still send messages from the
&#8216;Restless,&#8217;&#8221; hinted Powell Seaton.</p>
<p>Tom Halstead bounded for the door of the
dynamo shed with a sudden exclamation of
dread.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can use the boat&#8217;s wireless,&#8221; nodded
Joe, following, and speaking over his shoulder,
&#8220;unless the same crowd of rascals have broken
into the boat&#8217;s motor room or cabin and played
us the same trick there.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the big sitting room, beside the large open
fire-place, was a pile of long sticks of firewood.
Tom Halstead stopped to snatch up one of these,
and Joe quickly followed suit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go down to the boat with you, boys,&#8221;
said Mr. Seaton, who had followed them. &#8220;If
there&#8217;s anyone around to put up a fight you&#8217;ll
want some help.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Captain Tom, acting, for the moment, as
though he were aboard the yacht, suddenly took
command.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Seaton,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;d better remain
here to guard your unconscious friend. Doctor,
wake up! Better go in and send Hank Butts
out on the trot. We&#8217;ll take him with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Cosgrove, awaking and realizing that
something important was happening, swiftly
moved off to the sick-room. Hank was speedily
out with his comrades.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If there are rascals on this island, who have
designs against you, Mr. Seaton, then mount
guard over your friend,&#8221; Tom added. &#8220;Better
be in the sick-room at any moment when
Dr. Cosgrove leaves there. Hank, get a club
from that pile. Now, come along, fellows, and
we&#8217;ll see what infernal mischief may have been
done to the &#8216;Restless.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>With that, the young skipper bounded out
onto the porch, thence running down the board
walk toward the dock.</p>
<p>Tom Halstead had some vague but highly uneasy
notions as to the safety of his beloved boat.
Yet, alarmed as he was, he was hardly prepared
for the shock that met him when he arrived at
the edge of the little wharf.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, can you beat that?&#8221; panted young Halstead,
halting, thunderstruck, and gazing back
at his stupefied comrades. &#8220;The rascals&mdash;whoever
they are&mdash;have stolen the &#8216;Restless.&#8217; Joe,
our splendid boat is gone!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>TAKING A GREAT CHANCE</h3>
</div>
<p>Joe, with a voiceless gulp, sprang forward
once more, pausing at the string-piece
only, and peering hard out into the black,
wet night.</p>
<p>Hank Butts brought his club down over a
snubbing post with such force as to shatter the
weapon.</p>
<p>For a few moments Tom Halstead stood looking
about him in an uncertain way, as though
trying to arouse himself from a hideous nightmare.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve stolen our boat!&#8221; he gasped.</p>
<p>Whoever had done this deed might almost as
well have taken the young captain&#8217;s life. The
&#8220;Restless&#8221; was a big part of that life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; muttered Hank, thickly, &#8220;whoever
took the yacht must leave it somewhere.
You can&#8217;t hide a craft of that size. We&#8217;ll hear
from the &#8216;Restless&#8217; all right, in a day or two&mdash;or
in a week, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever took the yacht away from here
may know next to nothing about handling a
boat,&#8221; choked Tom, hoarsely. &#8220;We may find
the dear old craft again&mdash;yes&mdash;but perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
wedged on the rocks somewhere,&mdash;a hopeless
wreck. O-o-oh! It makes me feel ugly and
heartsick, all in one!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Restless&#8217; can&#8217;t have broken loose during
the storm, can it?&#8221; asked Hank Butts.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; retorted Tom and Joe in the same
breath, and with the utmost positiveness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what are we going to do?&#8221; asked
Hank.</p>
<p>The answer to the question was hard to find.
Lonely Island lay five miles off the shore. Wireless
communication was out of the question.
They were out of the track of passing vessels,
nor was any stray, friendly craft at all likely
to show up on this dark, forbidding night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on back, fellows,&#8221; said Tom, chokingly.
&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing we can do here, and
Mr. Seaton must know the whole situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The owner of the bungalow listened to them
with a blank face when the Motor Boat Club boys
again stood before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t even guess what to make out of
this,&#8221; he confessed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would help Dalton greatly if Mr. Clodis
died to-night, wouldn&#8217;t it, sir?&#8221; inquired the
young skipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would help Dalton much, and be of still
greater value to the wretches behind Dalton,&#8221;
replied Mr. Seaton, grinding his teeth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then, sir, as the tug went back to mainland
with two of the doctors, isn&#8217;t it possible
that some spy may have concluded that <i>all</i>
the doctors had returned until summoned
again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That seems very likely,&#8221; nodded the owner
of the bungalow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then perhaps Dalton&mdash;and those behind him&mdash;hope
that Mr. Clodis will become much worse,
and die before you can again summon help from
the mainland.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That looks more likely than any other explanation
of these strange happenings,&#8221; agreed
Mr. Seaton, studying the floor, while the frown
on his face deepened.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the scoundrels,&#8221; quavered Tom, &#8220;may
even come back during the night and try to
make <i>sure</i> that Mr. Clodis dies without ever becoming
conscious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite see why they need care so
much,&#8221; replied Mr. Seaton, slowly. &#8220;Dalton
got all of Clodis&#8217;s papers&mdash;the ones that I
wanted preserved from the wretches back of
Dalton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure they have <i>all</i>?&#8221; propounded
Captain Halstead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Clodis carried the papers in a money-belt,
and, in undressing him, we found that belt
gone.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Have you looked through the baggage that
we brought ashore with Mr. Clodis?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t thought of it. Haven&#8217;t had time,&#8221;
replied Mr. Seaton. &#8220;But I will now. Mr. Clodis&#8217;s
steamer trunk is in the room with him.
We&#8217;ll bring it out, and search.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom and Hank brought the trunk out.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lock hasn&#8217;t been tampered with, you
see, sir,&#8221; suggested Halstead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here are Clodis&#8217;s keys,&#8221; replied Powell
Seaton, producing a ring. One of the keys he
fitted to the trunk lock, next throwing up the
lid. After rummaging for a few moments, Mr.
Seaton brought up a sealed envelope from the
bottom of the trunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dalton <i>would</i> have been glad to get this,&#8221;
he cried, with a near approach to delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lock it up tight in your innermost pockets
then, sir,&#8221; counseled Tom Halstead. &#8220;The contents
of that envelope must be what Dalton has
come back here for, or sent someone else for.
And, until he gets it, he must plan to keep
Lonely Island out of touch with the whole world.
We&#8217;ll hear from him again to-night, I&#8217;m thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will we?&#8221; flared Mr. Seaton, stepping
briskly across the room. Unlocking a cupboard
door, he brought out a repeating shot-gun.
From an ammunition box he helped himself to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
several shells, fitting six of them into the magazine
of the gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buckshot talks, sometimes,&#8221; said the owner
of the bungalow, more quietly. &#8220;I shall be
awake to-night, and have this gun always with
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any other weapons, sir?&#8221; asked
Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; a revolver&mdash;here it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Powell Seaton held out the weapon, but Halstead
shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Cosgrove is the one who&#8217;ll want that,
since he must stay by Mr. Clodis to-night. And,
see here, Mr. Seaton, impress upon the doctor
that he mustn&#8217;t take a nap, even for a moment.
As for you, you&#8217;ll want to be watching the house
in general.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, where will you young men be?&#8221; inquired
Mr. Seaton.</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t stay indoors, with our boat
gone, sir,&#8221; Tom answered. &#8220;The first thing we
must do is to explore all around the island.
Even if we don&#8217;t get a sign of the &#8216;Restless,&#8217; we
may find out something else. We may be able
to catch someone trying to land on this island
later to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; it will be best to have guards outside
roaming about the island,&#8221; admitted Powell
Seaton, readily. Then, lowering his voice as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
signed to the Motor Boat Club boys to draw
closer to him, Mr. Seaton added:</p>
<p>&#8220;Something, of some nature, <i>will</i> be attempted
to-night. There is no other sound explanation
of the crippling of the wireless and
the stealing of the boat. So be vigilant, boys&mdash;as
I shall also be while you&#8217;re gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hank helped himself to a fresh club&mdash;a
stouter one than that which he had broken over
the snubbing post at the dock. Then out into
the black night fared the three Motor Boat Club
boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we keep together, or spread?&#8221; asked
Joe Dawson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Together,&#8221; nodded Tom Halstead. &#8220;If
there are prowlers about, we can&#8217;t tell how soon
three of us may be even too few. Remember,
we have only firewood to fight with, and we
don&#8217;t know what kind of men we may run up
against.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Tom led his friends down to a point but
little south of the dock. From here, following
the shore, they started to prowl slowly around
Lonely Island, all the while keeping a sharp
watch to seaward.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the boat is in any waters near at hand we
ought to get some sign of her whereabouts by
keeping a sharp enough watch,&#8221; Tom advised
his comrades. &#8220;They can&#8217;t sail or handle the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
boat without the occasional use of a light in the
motor room. The gleam of a lantern across the
water may be enough to give us an idea where
she is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peering off into the blackness of the night,
this seemed like rather a forlorn hope.</p>
<p>&#8220;If whoever has stolen the boat intends to
land later to-night,&#8221; hinted Joe, &#8220;it&#8217;s much
more likely that the thieves are, at this moment,
a good, biggish distance away, so as not to give
us any clew to their intentions.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the course of twenty minutes the Motor
Boat Club boys had made their way around to
the southern end of the island.</p>
<p>Somewhat more than a mile to the southward
lay a small, unnamed island. It was uninhabited,
and too sandy to be of value to planters.
Yet it had one good cove of rather deep
water.</p>
<p>Tom halted, staring long and hard in the direction
where he knew this little spot on the
ocean to stand. It was too black a night for
any glimpse of the island to be had against the
sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be a good enough place for our
pirates to have taken the &#8216;Restless,&#8217;&#8221; he muttered,
to his comrades.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we only had a boat, we could know, bye-and-bye,&#8221;
muttered Hank, discontentedly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We have been known to swim further than
that,&#8221; said Joe, quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But never in such a sea as is running to-night,&#8221;
sighed Tom Halstead. &#8220;Even as the
water is, I&#8217;d like to chance it, but I&#8217;m afraid it
would be useless. And it would leave Mr.
Seaton and the doctor alone against any surprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d swim that far, or drown, even in this
sea,&#8221; muttered Dawson, vengefully, &#8220;if I had
any idea that our boat lay over that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>For two or three minutes the boys stood there,
talking. Not once did Tom Halstead turn his
eyes away from the direction of the island to
the southward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look there!&#8221; the young skipper finally uttered,
clutching at Joe&#8217;s elbow. &#8220;Did you see
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; voiced Joe, in instant excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8221; was a tiny glow of light, made small
by the distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lantern, being carried by someone,&#8221;
continued Captain Tom, after a breathless
pause. &#8220;There&mdash;it vanishes! Oh, I say&mdash;gracious!&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe, too, gave a gasp.</p>
<p>As for Hank Butts, that youth commenced to
breathe so hard that there was almost a rattle
to his respiration.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>Immediately following the disappearance of
the distant light, four smaller, dimmer lights
appeared, in a row.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the same light, showing through the
four starboard ports of the motor room,&#8221; trembled
Joe Dawson. &#8220;Starboard, because the lantern
was carried forward, before it disappeared
briefly in the hatchway of the motor room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s our boat&mdash;there isn&#8217;t a single doubt
of it,&#8221; cried Tom Halstead, enthusiastically.
&#8220;And now&mdash;oh, fellows! We&#8217;ve simply got to
swim over there, rough sea or smooth sea.
We&#8217;ve got to get our own boat back unless the
heavens fall on us on the way over!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! What are we going to do,&#8221; demanded
Hank Butts, &#8220;if we find a gang aboard
that we can&#8217;t whip or bluff?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; spoke Captain Tom, softly, &#8220;will
have to be decided after we get there. But swim
over there we must, since there isn&#8217;t anything
on this island that even looks like a boat. See
here, Joe, you and Hank trot up to the bungalow
and tell Mr. Seaton what we&#8217;ve seen. The
&#8216;Restless&#8217; is at anchor in the cove yonder.
There are plenty of logs up at the bungalow.
Come back with one big enough to buoy us up
in the water, yet not so big but what we can
steer it while swimming. And bring with it a
few lengths of that quarter-inch cord from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
dynamo room. Don&#8217;t be too long, will you, fellows?&#8221;</p>
<p>After Joe and Hank had departed, Tom Halstead
watched the light shining behind the four
distant ports until it disappeared. Then he
looked at the waves long and wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a big chance to take. I don&#8217;t know
whether we can ever get out there in a sea like
this,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Yet, what wouldn&#8217;t I do
to get control of our own boat again? Our own
boat&mdash;the good old &#8216;Restless&#8217;! Joe isn&#8217;t saying
much of anything; he never does, but I
know how he feels over the stealing of the boat
and the chance that bunglers may leave her on
the rocks somewhere along this coast!&#8221;</p>
<p>A few minutes passed. Then the young skipper
heard hurrying footsteps. Joe and Hank
hove into sight out of the deep gloom, bearing
an eight-foot log on their shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good enough,&#8221; nodded Halstead, eyeing the
log approvingly. &#8220;Now, wade into the water
with it, and let&#8217;s see whether it will buoy us all
up at need.&#8221;</p>
<p>All three waded out with the log, until they
were in nearly up to their shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, hang to it, and see if it will hold us
up,&#8221; commanded Captain Tom Halstead.</p>
<p>The log bore them up, but the crest of a big
wave, rolling in, hurled them back upon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
beach. Tom dragged the log up onto dry
ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, first of all, let&#8217;s lash our clubs to the
log,&#8221; suggested the young skipper. This was
soon accomplished. Then each of the Motor
Boat Club boys made a medium length of the
cord fast around his chest, under the arm-pits.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next trick,&#8221; proposed Halstead, &#8220;is to
make the other end fast to the log, allowing just
length enough so that you can swim well clear
of the log itself, and yet be able to haul yourselves
back to the log in case you find your
strength giving out.&#8221;</p>
<p>This took some calculation, but at last the
three motor boat boys decided that eight feet
of line was the proper length. This decided, and
accomplished, they carried the log down into the
water, and pushed resolutely off into the blackness.</p>
<p>Even Tom Halstead, who allowed himself few
doubts, little believed that they could accomplish
this long, dangerous swimming cruise
over a rough sea.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>TOM MATCHES ONE TRICK WITH ANOTHER</h3>
</div>
<p>At the outset Joe swam at the rear, frequently
giving a light push to send the
log riding ahead. Tom and Hank swam
on either side, half-towing the timber that was
to be their buoy when needed.</p>
<p>All three, reared at the edge of salt water, as
they had been, were strong, splendid swimmers.
This night, however, with the rough waves, the
feat was especially dangerous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swim the way a fellow does when he knows
he&#8217;s really <i>got</i> to,&#8221; was the young skipper&#8217;s
terse advice as they started.</p>
<p>It became a contest of endurance. Tom and
Joe, the two Maine boys, were doggedly determined
to reach their boat or perish in the attempt.
Hank Butts, the Long Island boy,
though perhaps possessing less fine courage
than either of his comrades, had a rough way
of treating danger as a joke. This may have
been a pretense, yet in times of peril it passed
well enough for grit.</p>
<p>Any one of the three could have swum a mile
readily on a lightly rolling sea, but to-night the
feat was a vastly sterner one. Hank was the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
first to give out, after going a little more than
an eighth of the distance. He swam to the log,
throwing his right arm over it and holding on
while the two Maine boys pushed and towed it.
Finally, when young Butts had broken away to
swim, Joe closed in, holding to the log for a
while. At last it came even doughty Tom Halstead&#8217;s
turn to seek this aid to buoyancy.</p>
<p>Nor had they covered half the distance, in all,
when all three found themselves obliged to hold
to the log, as it rolled and plunged, riding the
waves. Worst of all, despite their exertions, all
three now found their teeth chattering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, it begins to look like a crazy undertaking,&#8221;
declared Hank, with blunt candor.
&#8220;Can we possibly make it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to,&#8221; retorted Tom Halstead, his
will power unshaken.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see the light over there any more,&#8221;
observed Hank, speaking the words in jerks of
one syllable, so intense was the shaking of his
jaws.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe the boat isn&#8217;t over yonder any
longer,&#8221; admitted Captain Tom, &#8220;but we&#8217;ve got
to chance it. And say, we&#8217;d better shove off and
try to swim again, to warm ourselves up. We&#8217;re
in danger of shaking ourselves plum to pieces.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was another great peril, on which none
of them had calculated well enough before starting.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
When they were clear of the log, swimming,
it pitched so on the tops of the waves that
it was likely, at any instant, to drive against the
head of one of the swimmers and crack his skull.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we had known all this before we
started&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; began Hank, the next time the
three swimmers were driven to cling, briefly, to
their movable buoy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d have started just the same,&#8221; retorted
Tom, as stiffly as his chattering teeth would let
him speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; muttered Hank, unbelievingly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a fool&#8217;s dream, this kind of a swim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s less work to go ahead than to turn back,
now,&#8221; broke in Joe, his teeth accompanying his
words with the clatter of castanets.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; the wind and tide would be with us
going back,&#8221; objected Butts. &#8220;We could almost
drift back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And die of chills on the way,&#8221; contended
Tom, doggedly. &#8220;No, sir! We&#8217;ve got to go
ahead. I&#8217;m swimming to the tune of thoughts
of the galley fire aboard the &#8216;Restless&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Br-r-r!&#8221; shook Hank, as the three cast loose
from the log once more and struck out, panting,
yet too cold to stay idle any longer.</p>
<p>It was tantalizing enough. The longer they
swam, the more the boys began to believe that
the island they sought was retreating from before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
them. Hank was almost certain they were
moving in a circle, but Halstead, with a keen
sense of location, insisted that they were going
straight, even if very slowly, to the nameless
island.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see it,&#8221; breathed the young skipper, exultantly,
at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&mdash;the island?&#8221; bellowed Hank Butts.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but I&#8217;d swear I saw the &#8216;Restless&#8217; the
last time we rode a high wave,&#8221; Halstead
shouted back.</p>
<p>Ten minutes afterwards all three of the Motor
Boat Club boys caught occasional glimpses of
something dark and vague that they believed to
be the hull of their yacht. The belief gave them
renewed courage. Even Hank no longer had
any desire to turn back. His whole thought
centered on the lively times that were likely to
begin when they tried to regain control of their
boat from whomever had stolen it.</p>
<p>Then, bit by bit the trio worked their log
buoy into the cove. Once they were inside, the
water was very much smoother. Resting a few
moments for breath, they then made a last dash
forward, to get alongside.</p>
<p>In this smoother, more shallow water, the
&#8220;Restless&#8221; rode securely at anchor. As they
swam closer, the boys found that they could discover
no human presence on the decks. Had the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
boat-stealers gone ashore on the nameless island?
If so, it would be a comparatively easy matter
to get aboard and cut out of the cove with their
own craft.</p>
<p>Close up alongside they went. Tom Halstead
was the first to be able to reach up at the hull
and draw himself up over the side. Then, with
his pocket-knife, as he lay at the rail of the
&#8220;Restless,&#8221; the young skipper slashed the cord
that still held him bound to the log. Reaching
over, he passed the knife to Hank. In utter
silence the Long Island boy cut the clubs free,
and passed them up. Next Hank drew himself
aboard, after passing the jackknife to Joe Dawson.</p>
<p>Just a little later all three of the Motor Boat
Club boys found themselves standing on the deck,
each grasping his own firewood weapon. They
made no noise, for they knew not who, or
how many others might be on board below. If
they had a desperate gang of thieves to contend
with, then their troubles had not yet even
begun!</p>
<p>Joe and Hank stood where they were, shaking
as though in the last ditch of ague, while Halstead
went forward, with the soft tread of a cat,
to peer down into the motor room, the hatchway
of which stood open.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder if there&#8217;s anyone down there,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
asleep, or playing possum?&#8221; thought the young
skipper as he peered into the blackness and listened.
No sound of any kind came up to him.
At last, a short step at a time, Halstead descended
into the motor room, groping cautiously
about. Finally, he became confident enough to
feel in the galley match-box, extract a match and
light it. The tiny flame showed him that the
motor room was empty of human presence other
than his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one down forward,&#8221; he reported, in a
shaking whisper, when he rejoined his chilled
companions on deck.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe there are plenty of folks in the
cabin, though,&#8221; reported Joe. &#8220;They&#8217;ve drawn
the port-hole and transom curtains, but they&#8217;ve
got a hidden light down there, and I can hear
voices.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment, then,&#8221; said Captain Tom,
apprehensively. &#8220;I&#8217;ve an idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>He crept back into the motor room, again
striking a match. By the aid of this feeble light
he found his way to the passageway that connected
the motor room and the cabin under the
bridge deck. After a brief inspection he hurried
back to his comrades.</p>
<p>&#8220;The passage door is padlocked on the motor
room side,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Our pirates had
no key to unlock that with. Now, can you walk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
the deck as though your shoes were soled with
loose cotton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; grumbled Hank, disjointedly, &#8220;but
the snare-drum solo my teeth are doing may
make noise enough to give me away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cram your handkerchief between your
teeth,&#8221; retorted Captain Tom, practically.
&#8220;Come along, fellows. But hold your clubs
ready in case your feet betray you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stealing along, each holding to the edge of
the deck house with one hand, the motor boat
boys approached the after hatchway. This, evidently
for purposes of ventilation, had been
left partly open.</p>
<p>Nudging his comrades to pause, Joe, bending
so low as to be almost flat on the deck, prowled
further aft.</p>
<p>There, in the darkness, he used his eyes to find
out what might be down in the cabin. Then he
came back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eight tough-looking men in the cabin,&#8221; he
whispered, in Tom Halstead&#8217;s ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Anson Dalton one of them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! Then we&#8217;ve bagged him, at last!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have we, though?&#8221; muttered Joe Dawson,
dubiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re going to,&#8221; declared Tom, radiantly.
&#8220;My boy, we&#8217;re going to cut out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
this cove with, the whole crew held in down
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hope so,&#8221; assented Joe, not very enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, we&#8217;ve got to,&#8221; argued Halstead. &#8220;If
we don&#8217;t, then that crew would have the upper
hand, instead, and make penny jumping-jacks
of us until they saw fit to let us go. But wait a
moment. I must get back and have a look at
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>This time it was the young skipper who
crawled aft. Joe and Hank followed part of
the way, holding their sticks in readiness in case
Dalton and his men discovered their presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon, Cap, you&#8217;ll find you&#8217;ve got the
right crowd for to-night&#8217;s work,&#8221; a rough voice
was declaring, as Halstead came within ear
range.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t you men misunderstand me,&#8221;
replied Anson Dalton in a smooth yet firm voice.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not paying you for any piratical acts. I
have to give a little heed to the laws of the
land, even if you fellows don&#8217;t. What I want is
this: At about two in the morning, when, most
likely, everyone will be asleep except the one
who is nursing the fellow Clodis, it is my plan
to run in at Lonely Island&#8217;s dock. We&#8217;ll get
quietly up to the house, suddenly force the door,
and rush in. But, mind you all, there&#8217;s to be no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
riot. Your numbers, and your rough appearance,
will be enough to scare the folks of the
bungalow. The two of you that I&#8217;ve already
picked out will rush in with a stateroom door
and one of the stateroom mattresses. With this
for a stretcher, you two will get Clodis carefully
and gently down to this boat. Then we&#8217;ll
sail away, and I&#8217;ll tell you what to do next. But
remember, no violent assault on anyone&mdash;no lawlessness,
no hurting anyone badly. Trust to
your numbers and suddenness. There&#8217;s some
baggage, too, in the bungalow, that I mean to
bring away with me. I&#8217;ll make off with it in the
confusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, will you?&#8221; wondered Captain Tom Halstead,
his jaw settling squarely.</p>
<p>Then, tiptoeing softly over to where Hank
waited, the young skipper whispered something
in that youth&#8217;s ear. Hank fled quietly forward,
but returned with a snap-padlock, the ring of
which was open. With this in his hands Tom
stole back aft, this time going close, indeed, to
the hatchway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey! Someone on deck,&#8221; roared an excited
voice below.</p>
<p>There was an instant babel of voices, a rushing
of feet and a general rumpus below. Two
men in the van raced for the hatchway.</p>
<p>Slam! snap! click! Tom Halstead swung
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
the hatchway door shut, forced the stout hasp
over the staple and fastened the padlock in
place!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>CARRYING DANGEROUS LIVE &#8220;FREIGHT&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Cooped!&#8221; chuckled Joe Dawson, jubilantly.</p>
<p>Yet his voice could not much more
than be heard above the racket that sounded below.
Anson Dalton and his seven rough men
were raising a hubbub, indeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Smash the door down!&#8221; roared Dalton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we kin do it, boss, but the hatch is a
stout one, and we ain&#8217;t jest &#8217;zactly fixed for
tools,&#8221; replied another voice.</p>
<p>After a few moments the fruitless hammering
with mere fists subsided. In that time Hank
Butts had raced forward, and now was back
again with a prize that he had caught up from
a locker near the motors. This was nothing
more nor less than the hitching weight that Hank
had once made very nearly famous, as described
in the preceding volume, &#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>The motor boat
club off long island</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em get out if they can,&#8221; advised Hank,
grimly. &#8220;This for the feet, or the head, of the
first roustabout that shows himself!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>Joe now raced forward to set the motors in
motion. Though the young trio had temporary
command of the deck, there was no telling how
soon they would be overwhelmed. Every moment
must be made to count.</p>
<p>Captain Tom, grasping his stick, stood by to
help Hank in case the furious ones below succeeded
in breaking out.</p>
<p>Hardly any time passed before the rhythmic
chugging of the motors came to the young skipper&#8217;s
delighted ears. Then Joe waved his arms
as a signal from the raised deck forward. Halstead
swiftly joined his chum. Together they
got the anchor up, stowing it well enough for
the present.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you&#8217;d better get back to Hank, hadn&#8217;t
you?&#8221; quivered Joe. &#8220;I can handle speed and
the wheel, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless you, old Joe!&#8221; murmured Captain
Tom, fervently, and raced aft. Dawson leaped
to the wheel, at the same time setting one of the
bridge controls so that the &#8220;Restless&#8221; began to
move forward under slow speed. This move
came just in time, for, even in the cove, the
water had motion enough to threaten the yacht
with grounding.</p>
<p>But now alert Joe Dawson swung the boat&#8217;s
head around, pointing her nose out of the cove.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get that hatch down in a hurry!&#8221; sounded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
Anson Dalton&#8217;s hoarse voice, imperiously. &#8220;If
you don&#8217;t, we&#8217;ll all be tight in a worse trap than
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blows with fists and feet resounded once
more. Then, after an instant&#8217;s pause, came the
slower, harder thump-thump which told that one
of the strongest of those caught below was using
his shoulder, instead. Soon two cracks seamed
the surface of the hatch door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! Go at it hard!&#8221; encouraged the
voice of Dalton. &#8220;Batter it down. It will be
worth money&mdash;and freedom&mdash;to you and to us
all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, just clear a passage, and see what happens!&#8221;
roared back Tom Halstead, as soon as
he could make his own voice heard distinctly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind the talk of those boys!&#8221; warned
Dalton, angrily, as there came a pause in the
shoulder assaults against the hatch.</p>
<p>With a grin Hank raised his iron hitching
weight above his head, hurling it down to the
deck with crashing force. Then, still grinning,
he stooped to pick it up again.</p>
<p>That noisy thump on the deck timbers caused
a brief ensuing silence down in the cabin. It
was plain that Dalton and his fellows were
wondering just how dangerous their reception
would be in case they succeeded in breaking
out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>The cabin was lighted, in day time, by side
ports and a barred transom overhead. The
ports were too small to permit of a man forcing
his way through. Even though they broke the
glass overhead, the prisoners in the cabin would
still have iron bars to overcome. Tom Halstead,
with his club, could hinder any work at
that point.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the &#8220;Restless,&#8221; once out of
the cove, was bounding over the waves like a
thing of life. Though the water had been hard
to swim through, it did not present a rough sea
for a fifty-five foot power boat.</p>
<p>In less than three minutes Engineer Joe Dawson
was sounding his auto whistle like mad as
he neared the dock at Lonely Island.</p>
<p>Just as the boat glided in, under decreased
headway, to the dock the bungalow door was
seen to open. Powell Seaton, shot-gun in hand,
appeared on the porch. He watched, not knowing
whether friend or foe commanded the &#8220;Restless.&#8221;
Mr. Seaton, himself, was made to stand
out brightly in the middle of the searchlight ray
that Joe turned upon him, yet he could not see
who was behind that light.</p>
<p>Running the boat in, bow-on, Joe leaped
ashore with the hawser. Making fast only at
the bow, he next raced up the board walk, shouting
the news to Mr. Seaton. The latter, with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
hail of delight, darted toward the dock, arriving
barely behind Dawson.</p>
<p>Down in the cabin the din of the men trying to
escape had redoubled. Powell Seaton tramped
hurriedly aft, while Tom and Joe fell in behind
him with heavy tread, to give the rascals below
an idea that numerous reinforcements had arrived.</p>
<p>Bang! Pausing before the hatch Mr. Seaton
raised the shot-gun to his shoulder, discharging
a single shell. Hastily slipping one into the
magazine of the weapon to replace the fired
one, Seaton shouted sternly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop your nonsense down there! If you get
out it will be only to run into the muzzles of
fire-arms. You fellows are fairly caught!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a startled silence, followed by indistinct
mutterings. Not even Anson Dalton,
it appeared, cared to brave what looked like too
certain death.</p>
<p>Tom held a whispered consultation with his
employer, then stepped over to young Butts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hank, we&#8217;re going to leave you on shore.
Mr. Seaton will come along with the gun. Keep
your eyes open&mdash;until you see us again! Don&#8217;t
be caught napping. Remember, you and Dr.
Cosgrove have the whole protection of that helpless
man, Clodis, <i>in</i> your hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hank Butts made a wry face for a moment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
He would have much preferred to see the present
adventure through. Yet, a second later,
the Long Island boy bounded to the dock, then
stood to cast off the bow-line.</p>
<p>After the line had come aboard, Joe Dawson
again took his place at the wheel, turning on the
speed gradually as the boat rounded out past the
island, then turned in toward the mainland.</p>
<p>It was about five miles, in a direct westerly
course, to the shore, but by an oblique, northwesterly
course a fishing village some nine miles
away could be reached.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steer for the fishing village,&#8221; nodded Powell
Seaton. Captain Tom hurried forward to give
the order, adding: &#8220;Make it at full speed, Joe.
If you have to go to the engine, call me forward
to take the wheel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon afterwards Tom slipped into the motor
room, rubbed down and got on dry clothing.
Joe, in turn, did likewise, afterward returning
to the wheel.</p>
<p>Down in the cabin all had been quiet for some
minutes after the discharge of the gun on deck.
Yet Captain Tom, by peeping through the
transom, discovered the heads of Dalton and
some of his rough men close together in consultation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll annoy them a bit,&#8221; chuckled the young
skipper, moving swiftly forward. Dropping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
down into the motor room he switched off all the
cabin lights. An instant roar of anger came
from below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny we didn&#8217;t think of that before,&#8221;
grinned Dawson, as Halstead came up out of
the motor room.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll bother the rascals a bit,&#8221; chuckled Captain
Tom back over his shoulder.</p>
<p>With such a boat as the &#8220;Restless&#8221; ordinary
distances are swiftly covered. It was barely
twenty-five minutes after leaving the dock that
Joe reached the entrance to the little harbor
around which the houses of the fishing village
clustered, nor had much speed been used.</p>
<p>Now the whistle sounded steadily, in short,
sharp blasts. Moreover, Dawson managed to
send the distress signal with the searchlight.
By the time he slowed down speed, then reversed,
to make the little wharf, a dozen men
had hurried down to the shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; hailed one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get the sheriff, or a sheriff&#8217;s officer!&#8221;
shouted back Powell Seaton. &#8220;Be quick about
it, one of you, please, and the rest of you stay
here to help us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe sent the bow hawser flying ashore, Tom
doing the same with the stern line. Willing
hands caught both ropes, making them fast
around snubbing posts. As two men started
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
away on the run, the rest of the bystanders came
crowding aboard, filled with curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happens to be wrong on board?&#8221; demanded
one bronzed fisherman.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve a cabin full of pirates, or rascals
about as bad,&#8221; returned Mr. Seaton, grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Men of this coast?&#8221; asked another speaker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, evidently,&#8221; nodded Mr. Seaton, whom
the new-comers had recognized as the owner of
Lonely Island.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then they must be the crew of the &#8216;Black
Betty,&#8217;&#8221; commented the first speaker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that a black, fifty-foot schooner, low in
the water, narrow and carrying tall masts with
a heavy spread of canvas?&#8221; interposed Tom
Halstead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded the fisherman. &#8220;That&#8217;s the
&#8216;Black Betty.&#8217; She claims to be a fishing boat,
but we&#8217;re ready to bet she&#8217;s a smuggler. She
carries nine men, including Captain Dave
Lemly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;ve got most of the &#8216;Black
Betty&#8217; outfit below, then,&#8221; declared Captain
Halstead. &#8220;Or else&mdash;gracious!&#8221;</p>
<p>For, at that moment, the cracked hatch gave
in with a smash. Powell Seaton had neglected
to remain on guard closely. There was a surge
of the prisoners below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Halstead, you&#8217;ll hear from me again&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
so will your crew!&#8221; shouted Anson Dalton out
of the press of struggling men that formed on
the after deck. &#8220;I won&#8217;t let you forget me,
Halstead!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a splash past the rail. Dalton had
gone overboard, followed by two of his companions.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>POWELL SEATON&#8217;S BAD CASE OF &#8220;FORGET&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let any more get away!&#8221; called
Powell Seaton, excitedly.</p>
<p>Tom Halstead promptly leaped at
one of the rough fugitives just as the latter was
trying to reach the wharf. Another one Joe
Dawson grabbed. Several of the fishermen
sprang to help. For a minute or two there was
a good deal of confusion. When matters quieted
down, it was found that Halstead and Dawson,
with the fishermen helping, had secured five of
the rough lot.</p>
<p>Powell Seaton, by threatening with his shot-gun,
had induced a sixth to swim ashore. But
Anson Dalton and another man, believed to be
Captain Dave Lemly of the &#8220;Black Betty,&#8221; had
escaped, swimming under water in the darkness.
They must have come to the surface at some
point not far away, yet, in the black darkness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
of the night, they managed to escape safely for
the time being, at any rate.</p>
<p>The six men thus arrested were forced inside
a ring of the fishermen, whose numbers had been
greatly increased by new arrivals. Powell
Seaton, his shot-gun on his shoulder, now
patrolled close to the human ring. Three or
four men hurried with Tom and Joe on a quest
for Anson Dalton and the latter&#8217;s companion in
flight.</p>
<p>In less than a quarter of an hour one of
the messengers who had first hurried away returned
with a deputy sheriff, who brought several
pairs of handcuffs. A justice of the peace
was aroused at his home, and held the prisoners
over for trial, after Powell Seaton had preferred
against them a charge of stealing the
yacht that was under his charter.</p>
<p>The search for Dalton and his companion was
given up, for it became plain that both had succeeded
in their effort to get away.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s altogether too bad,&#8221; sighed Mr. Seaton,
on coming out of the justice&#8217;s house. &#8220;However,
we can be thankful for what success we
have had. We have the boat back and have
balked Dalton&#8217;s rascals in what they were planning
for to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going back to Lonely Island now,
sir?&#8221; asked Captain Tom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We must, very soon,&#8221; replied Mr. Seaton.
&#8220;Yet, Halstead, I&#8217;ve been thinking that I cannot
afford to take any further chances, with
Anson Dalton still at large. These fishermen
are a rough but honest lot of splendid fellows
in their way. I&#8217;m going to see if I can&#8217;t hire
a special guard of eight men for Lonely Island
for the present. I&#8217;ll engage the deputy sheriff
to vouch for the men I engage. So go down
to the boat and be ready for me as soon as I
arrive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe was aboard, waiting, when the young skipper
returned. Several of the men of the village
were still about the dock.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re to be ready to cast off as soon as Mr.
Seaton gets here, Joe,&#8221; Captain Tom Halstead
announced. &#8220;Better look to your motors. If
you want any help, call on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>It did not take Mr. Seaton very long to recruit
the guard of eight men that he wanted.
Carrying rifles or shot-guns, borrowed in some
instances, the men tramped along after their
new employer. They came aboard, two or three
of them going below, the others preferring to remain
on deck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cast off, Captain, as soon as you can,&#8221; directed
Powell Seaton.</p>
<p>Two or three of the new guards sprang forward
to help in this work. Halstead rang for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
half speed, then threw the wheel over, making
a quick start. Once under way, he called for
full speed, and the &#8220;Restless&#8221; went bounding
over the waves, which were running much lower
than a couple of hours earlier.</p>
<p>During the first half of the run Captain Halstead
remained at the wheel. Then Joe came
up from below, relieving him. Tom strolled
back to take a seat on the deck-house beside Mr.
Seaton.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on tenterhooks to get back,&#8221; confessed
the charter-man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anxious about your friend, Clodis, of
course,&#8221; nodded Tom, understandingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Partly that, yes. But there&#8217;s another matter
that&#8217;s bothering me fearfully, too. You remember
the packet of papers I took from Clodis&#8217;s
trunk?&#8221; asked Mr. Seaton, lowering his
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; murmured Tom. &#8220;But you have
those in an inner pocket.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had!&#8221; uttered Powell Seaton.
&#8220;Halstead, the truth is, after you young men
went out, this evening, to patrol about the island,
I became a little uneasy about that packet, and
took it out and hid it&mdash;under some boxes of ammunition
in the cupboard where I keep my gun.
Then I locked the closet door. When Dawson
called me from the porch, in such haste, and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
was needed on board with my gun, I clean forgot
the packet for the instant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it will be safe, anyway,&#8221; Tom assured
his employer. &#8220;Even if Dalton had been able
to get a boat at once, in this neighborhood,
there&#8217;s no other craft in these waters capable of
reaching Lonely Island earlier than we shall
do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>do</i> hope that packet is safe,&#8221; muttered
Mr. Seaton, in a voice tense with anxiety. &#8220;Halstead,
you&#8217;ve no notion of the fearful blow it
would be to friends and to myself to have it disappear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hearing a slight noise on the opposite side
of the deck-house top, Seaton and Tom Halstead
turned together. They were just in time
to see one of the new guards leaning toward
them, one hand out as though to steady himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rough footing on deck to-night,&#8221; said
the guard, with a pleasant laugh, then passed
on aft.</p>
<p>Tom took the helm again as the &#8220;Restless,&#8221;
after picking up the landing place with the
searchlight, moved into the harbor and went to
her berth.</p>
<p>Powell Seaton led all of his guards but one
up to the bungalow. The eighth man, armed
with a rifle, was left aboard the &#8220;Restless,&#8221;
with the searchlight turned on, ready for use at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
any moment. Tom and Joe went up to the
bungalow with their employer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait out on the porch for just a little
while,&#8221; called Mr. Seaton, in a low voice. &#8220;And
be careful to make no noise that will disturb
the sick man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Five minutes later Mr. Seaton returned to
the porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been looking for that packet,&#8221; he whispered
to the young skipper. &#8220;It&#8217;s safe, so I&#8217;ve
left it in the same place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, after a moment, the owner of the bungalow
added:</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain, you can have your friend, Butts,
now, as we can do without him in the house. I
think you three had better turn in on the boat
and get some sleep. Then, soon after daylight,
I can have the guard at the wharf rouse you,
for I want you to go over to Beaufort and get
supplies for repairing the wireless outfit at the
earliest hour. Things are likely to happen soon
that will make it dangerous for me to be without
wireless communication with land and sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later the three Motor Boat
Club boys were stretched out in their berths in
the motor room. It was considerably later,
though, ere sleep came to them. When slumber
did reach their eyes they slept soundly until
called by the guard.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>Hank prepared a breakfast in record time.
After eating this, and after Hank had been sent
up to the house to learn whether there were any
further orders, the Motor Boat Club boys were
ready to cast off.</p>
<p>Once they were under way, Hank, not being
needed, went aft to stretch himself on one of the
cabin cushions. Joe, having his motors running
smoothly, followed Hank into the cabin. Dawson,
however, did not seek further sleep. He
wanted to make a more thorough test than he
had done a few hours before, in order to make
sure that the vandals locked in there the night
before had not thought to destroy his beloved
wireless instruments or connections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole wireless plant is in shape for instant
use,&#8221; he reported, coming back at last to
the bridge deck.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s mighty good news,&#8221; declared Tom
Halstead. &#8220;With the man we are working for
now we&#8217;re likely to need the wireless at any
minute in the twenty-four hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; ejaculated Joe, after a few moments
of silent thought, &#8220;there&#8217;s something hugely
mysterious and uncanny back of all these doings
of less than twenty-four hours. I wonder
what that big mystery really is?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE RED MESSAGE</h3>
</div>
<p>When the boys reached Beaufort and
had tied up at a wharf, it was still too
early to expect to find any shops open.
They left Hank on watch, however, and went up
into the town, Joe to look, presently, for a dealer
in electrical supplies, while Captain Tom sought
a ship&#8217;s joiner to fit and hang a new hatch to
replace that smashed in the affair of the night
before. Both boys were presently successful,
though it was noon before the joiner had his task
finished.</p>
<p>While the last of the work on the new hatch
was being done, Tom and Joe went once more
uptown to get a message from Mr. Seaton&#8217;s attorney
regarding the date when the formal hearing
of the men arrested the night before would
take place in court. Hank Butts was left to
watch over the boat and keep an eye over the
joiner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any strangers around here?&#8221; queried the
young skipper, after the joiner, his work completed,
had gone aboard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a young black boy,&#8221; Hank replied.
&#8220;He seemed curious to look over the boat, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
he didn&#8217;t offer to go below, or touch anything,
so I didn&#8217;t chase him off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cast off, Hank. Give us some power, Joe,
and we&#8217;ll get back to Lonely Island,&#8221; declared
the young captain, going to the wheel.</p>
<p>Hardly more than a minute later the &#8220;Restless&#8221;
was gliding out of the harbor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess Hank&#8217;s young negro visitor left a
note,&#8221; called up Joe, showing in the doorway of
the motor room and holding forth a note. Hank
took it, passing it to Halstead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mind the wheel a minute, Hank, please,&#8221; requested
Tom, looking closely at the envelope.</p>
<p>It was addressed only to &#8220;Halstead,&#8221; the
writing being in red, and thick, as though laid
on with the point of a stick. The message on the
sheet inside was crisp and to the point. It ran:</p>
<p style='font-size:0.9em; margin: 0.5em 2em'>
If you think your doings have been forgotten, you&#8217;ll soon
know differently!</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; muttered Joe, following up, and
taking the sheet as his chum held it out. &#8220;That
must be from Anson Dalton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or Captain Dave Lemly, of the &#8216;Black
Betty,&#8217;&#8221; returned Tom, without a trace of concern
in his tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a threat, all right,&#8221; muttered Hank
Butts, his hair bristling when the sheet came
into his hands. &#8220;Confound &#8217;em, I hope whoever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
sent this tries to make good&mdash;when we&#8217;re
looking!&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then Captain Tom changed the course
abruptly, the bows of the &#8220;Restless&#8221; sending up
a shower of spray that sprinkled Hank from
head to foot. As he turned to get out of the
way the wind caught the sheet written in red
from his hand, blowing it out across the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let it go,&#8221; laughed Tom. &#8220;We know all
the red message had to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The negro that I allowed on deck came on
purpose to drop the note where it would be
found,&#8221; muttered Hank.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter,&#8221; smiled Tom. &#8220;We&#8217;re always
glad to know that we&#8217;re remembered by nice
people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have that black boy here for a
minute or two,&#8221; grunted Hank, clenching his
fists.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; Tom Halstead queried. &#8220;He
probably didn&#8217;t have any guilty knowledge
about the sender.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That reminds me,&#8221; broke in Joe. &#8220;Stand
close by the motors a few minutes, will you,
Hank?&#8221;</p>
<p>With that Dawson vanished aft. When he
came back he announced:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just flashed the wireless word back to
Mr. Seaton&#8217;s lawyer about the message we got,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
advising the lawyer that it probably shows Dalton,
or Lemly, or both, to be in Beaufort. And
the lawyer was able to send me news, received
just after we left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The schooner, &#8216;Black Betty,&#8217; has just been
seized, thirty miles down the coast, by United
States officers. She&#8217;ll be held until the customs
men have had a chance to look into the charges
that the schooner has been used in the smuggling
trade.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was Lemly caught with her?&#8221; asked Tom,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No such luck,&#8221; retorted Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d feel better over hearing that Dave Lemly
was the prisoner of the United States Government,&#8221;
remarked young Halstead. &#8220;If he
keeps at liberty <i>he</i> is the one who is going to
be able to make Anson Dalton dangerous to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re beginning to be afraid of that
pair, are you?&#8221; asked Joe Dawson, looking
up.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not,&#8221; rejoined Tom Halstead, his
jaws firmly set. &#8220;A man&mdash;or a boy, either for
that matter&mdash;who can be made afraid of other
people isn&#8217;t fit to be trusted with the command
of a boat on the high seas. But I&#8217;ll say this
much about my belief concerning Dalton: For
some reason we&#8217;ve been in his way, and are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
likely to be much more in his way before we&#8217;re
through with him. If Dalton got a chance, he
wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to wreck the &#8216;Restless,&#8217; or to
blow her up. For any work of that sort Dave
Lemly is undoubtedly his man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What can make them so desperate against
Mr. Seaton?&#8221; queried Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t even guess, for we don&#8217;t yet know
the story that&#8217;s behind all this mystery and
the list of desperate deeds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if Mr. Seaton will ever tell us?&#8221;
pondered Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unless he thinks we really need to
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he has already hinted that it&#8217;s all in a
big fight for a fortune,&#8221; urged Hank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and we can guess that the fight centers
in South America, since that is where Clodis
was bound for when this business started,&#8221; replied
Skipper Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if there&#8217;s any chance that our
cruise will reach to South America?&#8221; broke in
Hank Butts, eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly likely,&#8221; replied Tom, with a shake
of the head. &#8220;If there had been even a chance
of that, Mr. Seaton would have arranged for
an option extending beyond the end of this
month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just my luck,&#8221; grumbled Hank, seating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
himself on the edge of the deck-house. &#8220;Nothing
big ever happens to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you&#8217;re hard to please,&#8221; laughed Joe,
turning and going down into the motor room.</p>
<p>They were not long in making Lonely Island,
where the &#8220;Restless&#8221; was tied up and the hatchways
locked securely. The boys were not required
to remain at the boat, one of the guards
being stationed, night or day, at the wharf.</p>
<p>Powell Seaton was much interested in the account
Tom gave him of the red message, though
he did not say much.</p>
<p>There was no change or improvement in the
condition of Mr. Clodis, who still lay in a darkened
room, like one dead.</p>
<p>That afternoon Joe, with some help from his
comrades, repaired the bungalow&#8217;s wireless
plant and got in touch with the shore once
more.</p>
<p>Through the night four men were kept on
guard, one on the porch, another at the wharf,
and two others patrolling the island. No attempt
of any sort on the part of Dalton or the
latter&#8217;s confederates was discovered.</p>
<p>The next morning brought still no change in
the condition of Clodis. He was alive, breathing
feebly, and Dr. Cosgrove was attempting to
ward off an attack of brain fever.</p>
<p>Through the forenoon Joe was kept rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
busy sending messages ashore to the authorities,
for Powell Seaton, though not leaving the
island, was waging a determined campaign to
get hold of Dalton.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t need Dalton, particularly,&#8221; confessed
Mr. Seaton, as he sat with the three motor
boat boys at the noon meal. &#8220;But it would be
worth a very great deal of money to get back
the papers that Dalton must have stolen after
assaulting my sick friend, yonder, on board the
&#8216;Constant.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you&mdash;do you know&mdash;what was in the
stolen papers?&#8221; asked Captain Tom Halstead,
hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, indeed,&#8221; rejoined their employer,
with emphasis. &#8220;But the real trouble is that I
don&#8217;t want to have that knowledge pass to the
gang that are behind Anson Dalton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet Dalton must have had time to join his
principals, or confederates, by this time, and
turn the papers over to them,&#8221; hazarded Halstead.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s hardly likely,&#8221; murmured Powell
Seaton, &#8220;since the gang of rascals behind Anson
Dalton must be, at this moment, somewhere in
the interior of Brazil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Tom, reflectively.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re curious, I see, to know what all this
great mystery means,&#8221; smiled Mr. Seaton.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t want to let myself be curious
about what is none of my business,&#8221; declared
Tom Halstead, bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell you the story now, just the
same,&#8221; replied Powell Seaton, in a still lower
voice.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>MR. SEATON UNBURDENS HIMSELF</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Really, I see no reason why I shouldn&#8217;t
tell you,&#8221; went on the charter-man of
the &#8220;Restless.&#8221; &#8220;When I first engaged
you youngsters and your boat for this
month I had little more in mind than using your
boat for pleasure cruising about here. Yet the
fact that you had a wireless equipment aboard
the &#8216;Restless&#8217; <i>did</i> influence me not a little, for
I had at least a suspicion that big affairs might
come to pass, and that telegraphing from ship
to ship might be wonderfully convenient.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the same time, I was careful to look up
the references that you gave me, Captain Halstead.
Those references were so wholly satisfactory
that I know I can trust you to serve me
as bravely and loyally as you have, in the past,
been called upon to serve others. And now, just
for the reason that you may be called upon to
take some big fighting chances for me, I&#8217;m going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
to tell you what lies back of the curtain of mystery
that you&#8217;ve been staring at.&#8221;</p>
<p>As his voice died out Powell Seaton arose,
locked the door and glanced out through the
windows. Then he returned to the table, motioning
to the boys to incline their heads close
to his.</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably,&#8221; began their host, &#8220;you&#8217;ve regarded
me as a wealthy man, and, until the last
two or three days, as one of leisure. I am reasonably
well-to-do in this world&#8217;s goods, but
most of my life, since I was twenty, has been
passed in storm and stress.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not necessary to tell you all about the
life that I have led. It will be enough to tell
you that, three years ago, not satisfied that my
fortune was large enough, I went to Brazil in
order to learn what chance there might be of
picking up money fast in that country.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Brazil there are many ways of making a
fortune, though perhaps not as many as right
here at home. However, there are fewer fortune-seekers
there. In coffee, rubber and in
many other staples fortunes may be made in
Brazil, but the biggest, wildest, most desperate
and scrambling gamble of all is found in the
diamond-digging fields.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the diamond fields have, perhaps,
been discovered, and their working has become
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
systematized to a regular, dividend-paying
basis. There are still, however, some fields not
yet located. It was a small field, but one which
I believe may be worth millions, that I located
somewhat more than a year ago. See here!&#8221;</p>
<p>From an inner pocket Powell Seaton drew
forth an ordinary wallet. Opening it, he
dropped out on the table six diamonds. Though
none was of great size, all of the stones were of
such purity and such flashing brilliancy that
the motor boat boys gazed at them in fascination.</p>
<p>&#8220;They must be worth a fortune,&#8221; declared
Hank Butts, in an awed, subdued tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly,&#8221; smiled Mr. Seaton. &#8220;These
stones have been appraised, I believe, at about
twelve thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>After passing the gems from hand to hand,
the owner of the bungalow replaced them in the
wallet, returning the latter to the same pocket
before he resumed:</p>
<p>&#8220;This new diamond field, a patent to which
has not yet been filed with the Brazilian Government,
is in the state of Vahia. There is no
harm in telling anyone that, as Vahia is a state
of great area. It is in a section little likely to
be suspected as a diamond field, and the chance
that someone else will accidentally discover and
locate it is not large.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yet you know the exact location&mdash;can go
right to it?&#8221; breathed Tom Halstead, his eyes
turned squarely on Mr. Seaton&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but I don&#8217;t dare go to it,&#8221; came the
smiling answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! May I ask why not, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Government of Brazil is, in the main,
an honest one,&#8221; replied Powell Seaton. &#8220;The
President of that country is an exactly just and
honorable man. Yet not quite as much can be
said for the governments of <i>some</i> of the states
of that country. The governor of Vahia, Terrero,
by name, is probably one of the worst
little despots in South America.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, as it happened, before I came to know
anything about this new diamond field I had
the bad fortune to make an enemy of Governor
Terrero. Some American friends were being
shamefully treated by this rascally governor,
and I felt called upon to become mixed up in the
affair. I even went so far that I incurred the
deadly hatred of Terrero. It was right after
this that I came upon my diamond field. But
Terrero&#8217;s enmity was pressing upon me, and I
had to flee from Brazil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Tom, wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know how things are done in South
America?&#8221; demanded Powell Seaton, impressively.
&#8220;If a man like Terrero hates you, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
has only to inspire someone to prefer a serious
charge against you. The charge may be wholly
false, of course, but officers and soldiers are
sent, in the dead of the night, to arrest you.
These wretches, when they serve wicked enough
officials, shoot you down in cold blood. Then
they lay beside your body a revolver in which
are two or three discharged cartridges. They
report, officially, that you resisted arrest and did
your best to kill the members of the arresting
party. This infamous lie all becomes a matter
of official record. Then what can the United
States Government do about it? And the governor,
or other rascally official, has triumphed
over you, and the matter is closed. Though an
honest man, Halstead, you are officially a desperate
character who <i>had</i> to be killed by the
law&#8217;s servants. It was such a fate that Terrero
was preparing for me, but I escaped his
wicked designs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That must be a nice country!&#8221; murmured
Hank Butts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet you say the President of Brazil is an
honorable man?&#8221; asked Halstead. &#8220;Can&#8217;t he
remove such a governor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The President would, in a moment, if he
could be supplied with proofs,&#8221; rejoined Powell
Seaton, with emphasis. &#8220;Governor Terrero is
a wily, smooth scoundrel who is well served by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
men of his own choice stamp. Terrero is
wealthy, and backed by many other wealthy
men who have been growing rich in the diamond
fields. In fact, though they are wonderfully
smooth about it, the Terrero gang are terrors to
all honest diamond men in that one part of
Brazil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So, then,&#8221; hinted Captain Tom, &#8220;you know
where to find one of the rich diamond mines of
the world, but you don&#8217;t dare go to it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d dare,&#8221; retorted Mr. Seaton, his eyes
flashing. &#8220;But what would be the use of daring?
I am almost certain to be killed if I ever
show my face in Vahia while Terrero is alive.
So, then, this is what I have done: Since my
return to this country I have been arranging,
ever so quietly, with moneyed men who have
faith in me and in my honesty. After much
dickering we have arranged a syndicate that is
backed by millions of dollars, if need be. And
we may need to spend a good deal of money
before we get through. We may even have to
try to turn Terrero&#8217;s most trusted lieutenants
against him. We won&#8217;t, if we can help it, but
we may have to. The stake is a big one!</p>
<p>&#8220;Through turning this business over to the
syndicate I am bound to lose the greater portion
of the fortune that might have been mine
from this great enterprise. Yet, even as it is,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
I stand to reap rich returns if ever the syndicate
can locate and secure the patent to the diamond
fields that I discovered.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this moment three members of our syndicate
are in Rio Janeiro. They are big, solid
American men of moneyed affairs. As far as
they permit to be known, they are in Brazil only
as a matter of vacation and pleasure. In truth,
they are awaiting the arrival of Albert Clodis
on the &#8216;Constant.&#8217; When he had arrived, with
the papers from me showing where and how to
locate the diamond field, they were to have
moved quickly, spending plenty of money, and
filing a patent to the fields. Under the law the
Brazilian Government would be entitled to a
large share of the find in precious stones, but
even at that our share would have been enormous.
Once the patent to the diamond field was
filed, the President and the whole National
Government of that country could be depended
upon to protect the owner&#8217;s rights, even against
the greed and treachery of Terrero. So all that
appeared to be left to do was to get to my
friends of the syndicate the two sets of papers
that would enable them to locate the unknown
diamond field. Neither set of papers is worth
anything by itself, but with the two sets the
field can be promptly located.</p>
<p>&#8220;My first thought was to send the two sets
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
of papers by two different men. Yet, strange
as it may appear to you boys, I could not decide
upon two men whom I felt I could fully trust
under all circumstances. You have no idea how
I have been watched, the last year, by agents of
Terrero. Dalton, though an American, is one
of the worst of these secret agents of the governor
of Vahia. <i>I</i> knew how thoroughly I was
being watched, and I, in turn, have had others
watching Anson Dalton as effectively as it could
be done in a free country like the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, to make this long story short, when I
had all else in readiness I decided upon Bert
Clodis as the one man I could fully trust to
deliver the two sets of papers to the members
of the syndicate at Rio Janeiro. I believed, too,
at the time, though I could not be sure, that my
relations with Bert Clodis were unknown to
Anson Dalton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet, not for a moment did I trust too thoroughly
to that belief. I had Dalton watched.
If he engaged passage aboard the &#8216;Constant,&#8217;
my suspicions would be at once aroused. We
now know that he secured passage, by mail, under
the name of Arthur Hilton. Beyond the
slightest doubt Dalton, that infernal spy, had
succeeded in discovering that I was sending
Clodis with the papers. Yet Dalton, or Hilton,
as he chose to call himself, did not go aboard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
the &#8216;Constant&#8217; openly at New York. I can
only guess that he boarded from the tug that
took off the pilot when the liner had reached
open sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had impressed upon Bert Clodis the importance
of keeping the two sets of papers
apart, and had advised him that it might not
be safe to deposit either in the purser&#8217;s safe,
from which they might be taken through the
means of a deep-sea burglary.</p>
<p>&#8220;So the probability is that Bert Clodis had
one set of papers concealed on his person. The
other set of papers&mdash;the one I now have safe&mdash;he
seems to have put away in his trunk, believing
that no one seeking to rob him would think
him simple enough to leave valuable papers in
a trunk that could be rather easily entered in
the hold of a liner.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I have already told you, I had the ship
watched at New York, and received a message,
after her sailing, which told me that no one
answering Dalton&#8217;s description had boarded the
&#8216;Constant&#8217; at her pier.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the liner entered this latitude Bert Clodis
was to send off a wireless message which,
though apparently rather blind, would be
enough to advise me that no one answering to
Dalton&#8217;s description had appeared among the
passengers or crew of the &#8216;Constant.&#8217; This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
news I awaited at the wireless station at Beaufort,
and you can imagine my anxiety.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was why, then,&#8221; broke in Joe, suddenly,
&#8220;when I received that message about the
injury to Mr. Clodis, you were able to break in
so quickly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded Mr. Seaton. &#8220;I was waiting,
and was on tenterhooks. I would have joined
you, and would have gone out in haste to receive
Bert Clodis myself, but I realized that, if I delayed
you, the big liner would get past us, and
Bert Clodis must most likely die on the way to
Brazil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why weren&#8217;t you out here, sir, at this bungalow,
where you could have received the message
as well, and then have gone out with us
on the &#8216;Restless&#8217;?&#8221; inquired Tom Halstead, with
deepest interest in this strange narration.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was at Beaufort,&#8221; responded Mr. Seaton,
&#8220;because I felt it very necessary to be where I
could use a private wire to New York that I had
reserved. I was, at that time, waiting for word
from New York of any possible discovery that
could be made concerning the movements of the
infamous Dalton, whom I did not then know, or
believe, to be on board the &#8216;Constant.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was silence for a few moments, but
Powell Seaton at last went on, thoughtfully:</p>
<p>&#8220;We now know that Bert Clodis did <i>not</i> deposit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
any papers with the purser of the ship.
One set of the papers, therefore, must have been
tucked away in his clothing. Dalton, after assaulting
Bert Clodis, or having it done, must
have rifled his pockets and found one set. He
even had time to look through them and discover
that that set was incomplete. Then, on
seeing Clodis&#8217;s trunk go aboard the &#8216;Restless&#8217;
with the injured man, Dalton guessed that the
remaining papers might be in the trunk. That
was why Dalton decided to leave the &#8216;Constant.&#8217;
But your flat refusal to let him go down into the
cabin, where the baggage had been taken, foiled
the fellow at that point. Then, fearing that he
would run into me, and that I might even resort
to violence, Dalton hailed that schooner, the
&#8216;Black Betty,&#8217; and made his momentary escape.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; interposed Halstead, &#8220;Dalton
has had plenty of chance to put <i>his</i> set of the
stolen papers in safe hiding. But isn&#8217;t it barely
likely that he had already engaged Captain
Dave Lemly to be hanging about in these waters
with that little black schooner?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wholly likely,&#8221; nodded Mr. Seaton, thoughtfully.
&#8220;However, boys, I have trusted you with
as much as my very life is worth in telling you
all this. I would rather lose my life than see
my friends, as well as myself, beaten in this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
great diamond game. As the matter now stands,
Dalton has won the first step, but he hasn&#8217;t
enough knowledge to enable his employer, Terrero,
to locate my precious find. I can duplicate
the missing papers, and the other set, which
I have here secure, I must also send to Rio
Janeiro by some other most trusted messenger,
should Clodis, poor fellow, die, or prove unfit
to make another attempt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you think, sir, that there&#8217;s only one
honest man on earth?&#8221; asked Tom Halstead, in
considerable surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are several men that I <i>believe</i> to be
honest,&#8221; returned the owner of the bungalow,
&#8220;yet only one that I know to be <i>honest</i>, and who
possesses at the same time the judgment to undertake
a mission like the one I have been telling
you about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it won&#8217;t really do Dalton any good to
start for Brazil unless he can get hold of the
contents of the other set of papers?&#8221; Halstead
asked, after a pause of a few moments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not until the fellow can get his clutches on
the papers that I have secretly locked in that
closet over there,&#8221; confirmed Mr. Seaton.
&#8220;And I have told none but you trustworthy
youngsters that the other set <i>is</i> hidden in such
an easy place to get at.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, as though struck by a thought, Powell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
Seaton crossed the room, drawing his key-ring
from a pocket. He fitted the right key to the
door, and swung the latter open. An instant
more, and there came from Mr. Seaton&#8217;s lips a
cry much like the frightened howl of a wild
beast.</p>
<p>&#8220;The second set of papers is gone&mdash;stolen
from here!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an almost simultaneous gasp of
consternation from the three Motor Boat Club
boys as they rushed forward. But they had no
need to search. Seaton had done that thoroughly,
and now he turned to eye them. As
he stared&mdash;or glared&mdash;a new thought came into
Seaton&#8217;s mind, reflecting itself in his eyes. The
boys could see him fighting against his own new
suspicion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Halstead,&#8221; cried Powell Seaton, clutching
at the side of the doorway, &#8220;I told you all about
this hiding place. I trusted you!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Tom Halstead&#8217;s turn to go deathly
white and stagger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean, sir, that YOU SUSPECT
ME?&#8221; demanded the young skipper, in a voice
choked with horror.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE TRAITOR AT THE AERIALS</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Wait! Don&#8217;t take anything too seriously.
I&#8217;ve&mdash;got to&mdash;think!&#8221;</p>
<p>Powell Seaton had stood, for two
or three moments, staring from Halstead to the
other motor boat boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! Well, this is good, but I don&#8217;t
like it,&#8221; grimaced Hank Butts, taking two steps
backward.</p>
<p>Powell Seaton began to pace the room, his
hands at his head. He looked like one who suddenly
found it impossible to think.</p>
<p>Hank opened his mouth to say something
angry, but Captain Tom checked him with a
look and a gesture.</p>
<p>&#8220;May we search in that closet for you, sir?&#8221;
called Halstead, when a thud told that the owner
of the bungalow had dropped heavily back into
his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may look there, if you want to. Anyone
may look there&mdash;now!&#8221; uttered the amazed
one.</p>
<p>Without saying more Tom, in deep agitation,
began the task he had invited upon himself.
Joe Dawson came and stood looking quietly over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
his chum&#8217;s shoulder, ready to help if necessary.
As for Hank, he stood, a picture of injured pride,
staring at the distracted man.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; there&#8217;s nothing here,&#8221; admitted Halstead,
at last. &#8220;At least, the only thing we&#8217;re
interested in isn&#8217;t here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it isn&#8217;t,&#8221; moaned Seaton. &#8220;Yet
you boys were the only ones I told. And, the
only time I left the house, it was safe upon my
return. I also told you boys that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he keeps on talking in that strain,&#8221; muttered
Hank, half-aloud, &#8220;I&#8217;ll make his head
ache!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you won&#8217;t,&#8221; uttered Captain Tom, gripping
his comrade&#8217;s arm almost fiercely.
&#8220;There&#8217;s trouble enough on the premises as it
is. Hold your tongue, Hank, until we&#8217;re all in
a good mood to say pleasant things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereupon, with a snort, Hank dragged a
chair into a far corner, and seated himself in it.</p>
<p>Halstead walked slowly to the table, on which
Mr. Seaton was resting his elbows, his face
buried in his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;There must be some explanation for this,
Mr. Seaton,&#8221; began the young motor boat skipper,
more calmly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind your first suspicion
of me, because&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not you, more than the others,&#8221; broke in
the bungalow&#8217;s owner, excitedly. &#8220;All of you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
young men knew about the hiding-place. You
were the only ones besides myself who did
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Hank gripped his fists tightly, but a
stern look from Joe Dawson prevented Butts
from giving any further expression of his feelings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t sit there like that, Mr. Seaton,&#8221; broke
in Tom Halstead, once more. &#8220;Whatever has
happened, something must be done&mdash;and it must
be the right thing, and at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can search us, if you want&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; began
Hank&#8217;s growling voice, but Joe Dawson stood
before him, towering in grim purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you open your mouth again, Hank,
until you&#8217;ve collected some sense,&#8221; warned Joe.
&#8220;Let Tom do the talking. He&#8217;s the captain,
anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; responded Powell Seaton,
looking up in a good deal of a daze. &#8220;I must
do something&mdash;quickly&mdash;yet what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If anyone has stolen the final set of papers,&#8221;
advanced the young skipper, &#8220;it must have been
either Dalton or someone working for him. In
either case, Dalton must now have the papers,
or he soon will have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what does this lead to?&#8221; inquired Mr.
Seaton, regarding his young captain dubiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, sir, it must be plain that the best
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
course is to drop all other steps and concentrate
every bit of your energy and ingenuity
on getting hold of Anson Dalton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet what can I do to him, if I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first place, you might charge him with
being the man who struck Albert Clodis over
the head. That would be enough to have your
man arrested on, even if you couldn&#8217;t prove the
charge. A charge that you <i>can</i> fight on is that
of having helped to steal the &#8216;Restless&#8217; the other
night. If you can only get the fellow locked up,
then you&#8217;ll have more time to find out whether
there&#8217;s any way of getting the missing papers
away from him, or from any hiding place in
which he has put them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lock the fellow up?&#8221; jeered Powell Seaton.
&#8220;Bah, boy, you don&#8217;t seem to realize the money
that&#8217;s behind him. Ten thousand dollars, or a
hundred thousand, it would all be the same,
and Dalton, out on bail, could flee in whatever
direction he wanted to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what <i>are</i> you going to do?&#8221; demanded
Captain Tom, incisively.</p>
<p>In this instant of utter uncertainty a tinkling
of a bell broke in upon them. It was the call
bell that Dawson had attached to the wireless
apparatus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember, <i>you</i> keep quiet,&#8221; almost whispered
Joe to Hank, then quitted the room
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
hastily. Butts suddenly began to grin sheepishly.
Rising, he sauntered over to a window.</p>
<p>Joe had hurried to the wireless room on the
mere chance that it might be a message for
Lonely Island. It was much more likely to be
the regular business of ships passing on the
sea. But as he entered the room Dawson heard
the clicking call from a receiving instrument:</p>
<p>&#8220;CBA! CBA!&#8221; That was Lonely Island&#8217;s
call surely enough.</p>
<p>Breaking in at the key, Joe sent the sparks
chasing each other up the aerials. Having answered,
he slipped on the head-band, fitting the
watch-case receivers over his ears. Picking up
a pencil, he wrote.</p>
<p>It was a rush telegram from Mr. Seaton&#8217;s
lawyer, up at Beaufort, and it read:</p>
<p style='font-size:0.9em; margin: 0.5em 2em'>
Man much resembles description of Dalton has just been
reported embarking on seventy-foot cruising motor boat
ten miles above this city. Man in command of boat positively
said to be Captain Dave Lemly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remain at wire for further talk,&#8221; Joe&#8217;s
trembling fingers signaled back. Then, leaping
up, he bounded into the next room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Read it to me,&#8221; Powell Seaton begged.</p>
<p>Tom Halstead took the sheet, reading rapidly
yet clearly. The young skipper was excited,
though he forced himself to remain cool.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s your call to action, Mr. Seaton,&#8221;
he wound up with.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but what action?&#8221; demanded the owner
of the bungalow. Ever since the discovery of
the loss of the papers this man had seemed all
but unable to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to overhaul that other motor boat,
though her length will have to be description
enough if we can&#8217;t get a better one,&#8221; declared
the young skipper. &#8220;Hank, go down and open
up the motor room. Start the motors going,
though be gentle. Don&#8217;t break anything, or put
the motors out of business. Joe, go back to
the wireless, and see whether you can get a more
exact description of that boat&mdash;especially the
course she is believed to have sailed on. Hustle!
Mr. Seaton, hadn&#8217;t you better inform Dr. Cosgrove
that you&#8217;ll be absent for a while?&#8221;</p>
<p>The owner of the bungalow moved as though
glad of directions that saved him the trouble
of thinking.</p>
<p>Joe promptly sent a wireless back to Beaufort
asking for a better description of the seventy-footer
and the last course upon which she had
been seen.</p>
<p>The only further word the lawyer&#8217;s informant
could furnish, as Joe ascertained ten minutes
later, was that the boat was painted a drab tint
and had a &#8220;smoke-stack&#8221; ventilator. When last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
seen the boat was heading out nearly due east
from her starting-point.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going out to meet a liner, for some port,&#8221;
clicked Tom, as he heard the news. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s
our business to find that drab motor boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Joe caught up his cap, Mr. Seaton looked
rather uncertainly from one boy to the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say we&#8217;re to go out on this jaunt over
the water,&#8221; remarked the owner of the bungalow.
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t know. Perhaps you want
me to go too badly. There may be something
behind&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop right where you are, if you please,
sir,&#8221; broke in Tom Halstead, a decided trace of
bitterness in his tone. &#8220;You&#8217;re still more than
half-inclined to suspect us boys of causing the
loss of the papers you had hidden in the closet.
I am not blaming you altogether, Mr. Seaton,
though you are doing us a great injustice. But
you <i>must</i> believe in us just at the present time,
for going with us offers you your only chance
of catching up with Dalton and saving your
own friends of the syndicate. Come along, sir!
Try to trust us, whether it seems wise or not,
since it&#8217;s your only chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young skipper seized his charter-man by
one arm, almost dragging him along. Yet
Powell Seaton, who was in a state of horrible
uncertainty, permitted this forcing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>Outside, on the porch, Captain Tom hesitated
for a moment, then, after glancing at the guards,
went on briskly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Seaton, I know you don&#8217;t want to carry
an armed force for purposes of attack on anyone,
and you wouldn&#8217;t have a right to do it, anyway.
But, as we may be attacked, if we run
afoul of Dalton and his friends, won&#8217;t it be
much better if you take at least a couple of
your armed guards from this place?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nodding curtly, Mr. Seaton called to Hepton
and Jasper, two of the guards, explaining
that they were needed for a cruise on the
&#8220;Restless.&#8221; The pair followed along after
the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can keep your rifles, just as well, in
the motor room,&#8221; suggested Captain Tom, and
the fire-arms were placed below.</p>
<p>Hank had everything in readiness for casting
off. Within forty-five seconds after boarding,
the &#8220;Restless&#8221; was under way, poking her nose
in a north-easterly direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better loaf later on, rather than now,
Joe,&#8221; proposed the young skipper. &#8220;See how
much speed you can crowd out of the motors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Powell Seaton chose to go aft, all alone, dropping
into one of the deck arm-chairs. For a
long time he remained there, moody and silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;What liner do you figure on Dalton trying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
to overtake and board?&#8221; queried Joe, coming
up at last out of the motor room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t just know,&#8221; confessed Tom,
pondering. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll tell you what you can do,
Joe. Leave Hank to watch the motors. You
go to the wireless apparatus and send out the
longest spark you can get. Direct your call to
any vessel bound for Rio Janerio, or Brazil in
general. If you get an answer from such a
craft, ask her latitude and longitude, course and
speed, so we can make for her directly.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Joe nodded, then dropped down into the
motor room, intending to go by the passageway
under the bridge deck, Tom noted a lurking
figure a few feet behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo! What are you doing there, Jasper?&#8221;
queried the young captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest mindin&#8217; my own business,&#8221; replied the
man, with a half-surly grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m minding mine, in asking you,&#8221; retorted
Halstead, quietly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like passengers so
close to me when I&#8217;m handling the boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose mebbe you don&#8217;t,&#8221; rejoined Jasper,
yet making no move.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you take a hint?&#8221; asked Tom, rather
bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where d&#8217;ye want me to stand?&#8221; asked the
fellow, sulkily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You could go further aft, for instance,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
replied Tom. One hand on the wheel, he stood
half-turned, eying this stubborn guard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, all right,&#8221; came gruffly from Jasper, as
he started slowly aft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m wrong for thinking much about
it,&#8221; muttered Tom, under his breath, &#8220;yet it
was this same man who was so close to us the
other night when Mr. Seaton and I were talking
about the papers hidden in the closet at
the bungalow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two or three minutes later a slight sound
caused the young skipper to turn with a start.
He saw Jasper in the very act of fitting a wire-nipper
to one of the parallel wires of the aerial
of the wireless.</p>
<p>In an instant Captain Tom Halstead jammed
his wheel and locked it. Then he dashed at the
fellow.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<a name='CHAPTER_XI_THE_DRAB_BOAT_SHOWS_HER_NOSE' id='CHAPTER_XI_THE_DRAB_BOAT_SHOWS_HER_NOSE'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE DRAB BOAT SHOWS HER NOSE</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;You keep off!&#8221; snarled Jasper, drawing
back on the defensive, holding the wire-nippers
so as to use them in defending
himself.</p>
<p>But, if the young captain of the &#8220;Restless&#8221;
knew any fear, at such moments, he didn&#8217;t permit
others to see it. He neither stopped nor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
swerved. Ducking in under Jasper&#8217;s extended
right arm, Tom closed with the fellow, grappling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Confound ye! I&#8217;ll have to throw ye over
into the water!&#8221; growled Jasper, fighting for a
hold around the boy&#8217;s waist and behind his back.
But Halstead fought to break the grip, at the
same time yelling:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hank! Here, mighty quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jasper fought, trying to force the young commander
to the rail. He had half succeeded when
Hank Butts raced on deck. Hepton, the other
guard, who had been lounging in the engine
room, was right behind Butts. Both of them
raced to reach the struggling pair. Hank
caught Jasper at the waist-line, while Hepton
took a hold at Jasper&#8217;s neck, forcing the fellow
back.</p>
<p>Then Tom sailed into the melee with renewed
energy. Jasper was a powerfully-built fellow,
but the three were too many for him. They
tripped Jasper, throwing him to the deck, and
Hepton sat upon his comrade&#8217;s chest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Halstead! You others! What does this
violence mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>Powell Seaton shouted the question sternly.
He had been disturbed by the racket and now
stood amidships.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get him over, face down,&#8221; panted Tom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
&#8220;We&#8217;ll make sure of the fellow before we begin
to explain. Hank, run for a pair of handcuffs!&#8221;</p>
<p>Butts was up and off like a shot, wholly liking
the nature of his errand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Halstead!&#8221; raged Mr. Seaton. &#8220;I insist
upon an answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a case of sea-bullying&mdash;that&#8217;s what it
is,&#8221; growled Jasper. &#8220;It&#8217;s an outrage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hepton,&#8221; warned the charter-man, &#8220;get up
off of Jasper&#8217;s chest. Let him go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you do it,&#8221; countermanded Tom Halstead.
&#8220;It won&#8217;t be safe. This fellow is a snake
in the grass. I caught him at his tricks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hepton had acted undecidedly for a moment.
Now, he concluded to stand by the young captain.</p>
<p>In a trice Hank was back. Now the three assailed
Jasper, rolling him over on his face. Tom
Halstead, himself, fitted the handcuffs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take the wheel, Hank, until I&#8217;m through
with this,&#8221; panted Tom, leaping up from the
treacherous guard. The locked wheel was now
steering the &#8220;Restless&#8221; over an erratic course,
but Hank swiftly had the boat on her true course
once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;I insist on knowing what this shameful business
means,&#8221; cried Mr. Seaton, glaring at his
young skipper.</p>

</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I should think you might. It&#8217;s an outrage!&#8221;
shouted Jasper.</p>
<p>&#8220;This fellow,&#8221; charged young Captain Halstead,
&#8220;was in the very act of cutting the aerial
wires with a wire-nipper when I caught him.
Why, I can show you the nippers he had.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom wheeled, to make a quick search along
the deck. Jasper grinned covertly for he had
thrown the nippers overboard in the struggle.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see!&#8221; flared the prisoner. &#8220;He talks
about nippers&mdash;but where are they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Halstead,&#8221; demanded Mr. Seaton, &#8220;do you
intend to obey me by setting this man free until
I&#8217;ve had an opportunity to investigate all sides
of this remarkable charge?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir, I do not,&#8221; rejoined Halstead, quietly
though firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you forget that I command here?&#8221; raged
the charter-man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me, but you don&#8217;t command,&#8221; retorted
Skipper Tom, respectfully. &#8220;It is true
that you have this boat under charter, but I am
the captain and one of the owners, and I must
handle trouble aboard in the manner that seems
best. I caught this man in a treacherous attempt
to make our errand this afternoon quite
useless. Jasper stays in irons until we reach
port. I&#8217;m sorry to be so stubborn with you,
Mr. Seaton, but, just now, you&#8217;ve a queer idea
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
that I&#8217;m working against you. I must save
you, sir, even from your own blindness.
Hepton, will you help me take this fellow
aft?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; nodded the guard, who, while he
had not seen the start of the trouble, much preferred
believing Halstead to Jasper.</p>
<p>Seeing that resistance might bring him nothing
but a beating, Jasper sulkily allowed himself to
be led along the deck. Down into the cabin he
was taken, there to be thrust into the starboard
stateroom. Joe, from his wireless table at the
forward end of the cabin, looked up with much
curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was trying to snip the wires in your
aerial,&#8221; Halstead explained, after turning the
key in the stateroom door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad you got him, then,&#8221; nodded Dawson.</p>
<p>Mr. Seaton had followed as far as the doorway.
There he halted, well convinced that he
could not, at present, persuade the young skipper
to change his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, if you&#8217;ll be good enough to come up to
the bridge deck, Mr. Seaton, I want to explain
matters to you, sir,&#8221; proposed the captain of
the &#8220;Restless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rather stiffly the charter-man followed. Hepton,
as though to show further good faith, took
pains to remain aft.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember the other night, when we
were coming back with the guard for Lonely
Island,&#8221; began Tom, in a low voice, &#8220;that we
found one of the new guards leaning well over
the deck-house behind our backs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; nodded Powell Seaton, coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That man, sir, was Jasper. To-day, when
we are out trying to trace Anson Dalton over
the open sea, I find that same fellow, Jasper,
trying to cut the parallel wires of the aerial.
Why should he do that unless he means to try to
prevent our catching up with Dalton? Now, sir,
putting two and two together, doesn&#8217;t it seem
mighty reasonable to suspect that Jasper overheard
what we were saying the other night, and
then watched his chance to steal the papers that
you and I thought were so safely hidden in the
cupboard at the bungalow? I know, Mr. Seaton,
you feel that you have some reason for suspecting
us boys. In view of what happened the
other night, and again this afternoon, isn&#8217;t it a
whole lot more sensible to trace your misfortunes
to Jasper?&#8221;</p>
<p>Powell Seaton, whose daze had continued ever
since starting on this cruise, now pondered
deeply, with knitted brows. At last, however,
he looked up quickly, holding out his right hand,
as he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Halstead, I begin to believe that I have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
too hasty and suspicious. I have hated myself
for distrusting any of you boys, and yet&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; smiled Tom, &#8220;you are beginning
to feel that there is not as much reason for suspecting
us as there is for believing that the
guilt of a mean theft lies at someone else&#8217;s
door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg you to forgive me, Halstead, you and
your mates. But I hardly know what I am
thinking or saying. My mind is in too deep
a turmoil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll forget it, Mr. Seaton,&#8221; continued Halstead,
as he pressed the other&#8217;s hand. &#8220;<i>I</i> can,
easily, and I hope you&#8217;ll do your best to believe
that you can trust us as fully as others
have done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may just as well come forward, Hepton,&#8221;
hailed Captain Tom, a few moments later.
&#8220;And I want to thank you for the way you
stood by me when I needed help so badly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever since we&#8217;ve been at the island I&#8217;ve felt
that I didn&#8217;t believe any too much in that man
Jasper,&#8221; muttered Hepton. &#8220;He has been acting
queer some of the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; asked Mr. Seaton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, for one thing, he always wanted the
night guard duty. And he growled at taking
the porch or the dock. What he wanted to do
was to roam off about the island by himself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
Whenever he came back he wanted to sit in
your sitting-room, at the bungalow, and the fellow
scowled if some of the rest of us showed
any liking for staying in that sitting-room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of that, sir?&#8221; asked Captain
Halstead, looking significantly at Powell
Seaton.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sets me to thinking hard,&#8221; replied that
gentleman, gravely.</p>
<p>Hepton glanced with natural curiosity from
one to the other. Then, finding that he was not
to be enlightened as to what had happened
ashore, he soon stepped aft again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s what you want to know, I reckon,&#8221;
announced Joe, in a low voice, as his head
bobbed up out of the motor room. In one hand
he held a slip of paper on which he had just
taken down a message. &#8220;Twenty miles north
of us is the Langley Line freighter, &#8216;Fulton.&#8217;
She&#8217;s headed this way, and coming at fourteen
knots.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skipper Tom received the paper, studying the
position and course as Joe had jotted them
down.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Langley boats run to Rio Janeiro, don&#8217;t
they?&#8221; asked Halstead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and every boat of that line carries a
wireless installation now, too,&#8221; Joe continued.
&#8220;She&#8217;s the only boat that answered my hail.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Take the new course, Hank,&#8221; called the
young skipper to the boy at the wheel, and rattled
it off. The &#8220;Restless&#8221; swung around to a
nearly northerly course.</p>
<p>&#8220;At her speed, and ours, it needn&#8217;t be many
minutes before we sight the &#8216;Fulton,&#8217;&#8221; judged
Halstead. &#8220;Hank, you keep the wheel. I want
a chance to handle my glasses.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the marine binoculars in his hand Skipper
Tom soon began to sweep the horizon.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s what the wireless did for us,&#8221; he
chuckled to Mr. Seaton. &#8220;Without our electrical
wave we wouldn&#8217;t have known, for sure,
that there was a Rio boat in these waters this
afternoon. And, but for getting the &#8216;Fulton&#8217;s&#8217;
position and course by wireless, we&#8217;d have swept
by to the eastward, away out of sight of the
freighter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Within a few minutes more the young skipper,
by the aid of his glasses, got a glimpse of a
steamship&#8217;s masts. A few minutes later the
upper works of her high hull were visible.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the &#8216;Fulton.&#8217; I know the Langley
type of freighter build,&#8221; Halstead explained,
eagerly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll soon be close enough to see
her name-plate through the glass. And&mdash;oh!&mdash;by
Jove!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom waved the glasses with a flourish, pointing,
then handed them to Powell Seaton.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look right over there to the north-westward,
sir, and you&#8217;ll make out that drab-hulled
seventy-footer. She&#8217;s just coming into sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see her,&#8221; nodded Mr. Seaton.</p>
<p>Captain Halstead took the glasses again,
studying both the seventy-footer and the
freighter intently, judging their relative speeds
and positions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dalton, or his friend, Lemly, has nicely calculated
the drab boat&#8217;s run,&#8221; declared the young
skipper of the &#8220;Restless,&#8221; &#8220;Dalton&#8217;s craft is
in fine position to stop the freighter. But we&#8217;ll
reach the &#8216;Fulton&#8217; first, and by some minutes,
too, sir. The drab boat looks like a good one,
but I believe we&#8217;re a shade faster in the
stretch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are we going to do when we overhaul
both craft?&#8221; wondered Powell Seaton, aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, sir, it will be easy enough to make the
&#8216;Fulton&#8217;s&#8217; captain refuse to take any such passenger
as Dalton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; demanded Mr. Seaton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just inform the &#8216;Fulton&#8217;s&#8217; captain that
Anson Dalton is a fugitive from justice. If you
do that, the freighter&#8217;s captain isn&#8217;t going to
take any chances on getting into subsequent
trouble with Uncle Sam. The captain will
simply decline to receive him as a passenger on
the high seas.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>Powell Seaton looked very cheerful for a
moment. Then a look of dark doubt crossed
his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;That will be all right, Halstead, unless it
happens that the captain of the &#8216;Fulton&#8217; is a
man on the inside of some official affairs down
in Brazil. If that be so, then your freighter&#8217;s
captain may recognize Dalton as a man of consequence&mdash;one
to be served at all hazards. For,
if a steamship captain of the Langley line must
be careful to stand well with the United States
authorities, he must also be no less careful to
keep in the good graces of some of the cliques
of Brazilian officers. So what if Dalton goes
aboard the freighter, and her captain sends us
a derisive toot of his whistle?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Halstead&#8217;s face showed his instant uneasiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that turns out to be the case, sir,&#8221; he
whispered, &#8220;you&#8217;ve lost your last chance to stop
Anson Dalton. He goes to Brazil with all the
papers for locating the diamond mine, and you
and your syndicate friends lose the whole big
game!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE SEARCHLIGHT FINDS A &#8220;DOUBLE&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>Yet, though his confidence in success had
received a severe jolt, Captain Tom
reached out for the megaphone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Run in straight and close, Hank,&#8221; he ordered.
&#8220;I want every possible second of conversation
before that drab boat gets within talking
distance of the &#8216;Fulton.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Restless&#8221; and the freighter were now
within a mile of each other, and almost head-on.
The drab boat, about two miles away, had
altered its course so as to pick up the freighter
at a more southerly point.</p>
<p>&#8220;Run to your table, Joe,&#8221; commanded the
young skipper, &#8220;and notify the &#8216;Fulton&#8217; that
we are going to hail her for a brief pow-wow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speed with which young Dawson worked
was shown by the fact that, when still half a
mile away, the big freighter, hailed by wireless,
began to slow down speed. It was plain
that she was going to lie to in order to hear the
whole of the hail from the &#8220;Restless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Scott, though! Look at that!&#8221; suddenly
ejaculated Tom Halstead.</p>
<p>The drab seventy-footer had suddenly gone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
about, making fast westerly time for the
shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go about after the seventy-footer, Hank,&#8221;
almost exploded Halstead, in the intensity of
his excitement over this new move. &#8220;Dalton
doesn&#8217;t seem to want to try the freighter now.
Follow Dalton back to shore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the &#8216;Fulton&#8217;s&#8217; slowing down. You&#8217;re
going to show him the politeness of telling the
freighter&#8217;s captain what it was all about, ain&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let Joe do it,&#8221; replied Tom, tersely.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the wireless for?&#8221;</p>
<p>Just at this moment Joe Dawson appeared
from below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our apologies to the freighter, Joe,&#8221; called
Skipper Tom. &#8220;Tell him we&#8217;re after the drab
boat. Tell him that our game is to stop a fugitive
from getting out of the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe again appeared just as the freighter began
to make full headway once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Carson sends you his compliments
from the &#8216;Fulton,&#8217; Tom, for chasing the fugitive
off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, we&#8217;re going to chase that fugitive
in,&#8221; uttered Halstead, grimly. &#8220;By George!
Look at the way that drab boat is beginning to
travel. Joe, we can&#8217;t let her lose us in this
fashion.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>As the &#8220;Fulton&#8221; passed out hull down, and
then finally vanished on the southern horizon,
the chase after the drab seventy-footer became
lively and exciting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you make out Dalton aboard of her?&#8221;
asked Powell Seaton, as Tom stood forward,
leaning against the edge of the forward deck-house,
the marine glass as fast to his eyes as
though glued there.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. If Dalton is aboard, he&#8217;s keeping
out of sight in the cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see, when the drab boat was more
head-on, whether Lemly was at the wheel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The man at the wheel wasn&#8217;t Lemly, sir,
though I believe that fellow is on board as the
actual captain,&#8221; Halstead answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! Is the Drab going to get away
from us?&#8221; questioned Hank, wonderingly.
&#8220;My, look at her bow cut water!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a faster boat than I thought,&#8221; Tom
responded. &#8220;But we don&#8217;t mean to let her get
away. Joe, how are we going on speed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t get another revolution out of the
twin shafts without overheating everything,&#8221;
Dawson replied, seriously. &#8220;Honestly, Tom, if
this speed doesn&#8217;t suit, I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ll have to
make the best of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t lose a single inch by bad steering,
Hank,&#8221; Halstead directed, looking around
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
at his helmsman. &#8220;Whenever you want relief,
let me know.&#8221;</p>
<p>For five miles the drab seventy-footer kept
her lead, though she did not seem able to increase
it. That craft was still heading shoreward,
and now the low, long, hazy line of the
coast was in sight, becoming every minute more
plain.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re going to head straight for the
shore, unless they&#8217;ve some slicker trick hidden
up their sleeves,&#8221; declared Tom Halstead.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder that they&#8217;re running so hard from
us,&#8221; mused Powell Seaton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most likely, sir,&#8221; responded the young skipper,
&#8220;because Dalton and Lemly believe we
have officers aboard. Of course they know&mdash;or
suspect&mdash;that warrants are out charging
them with stealing the &#8216;Restless&#8217; the other
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose Dalton and Lemly are not aboard
that boat?&#8221; challenged Mr. Seaton, suddenly.</p>
<p>Tom Halstead&#8217;s lower jaw sagged for just an
instant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, there&#8217;s that chance. We may
have been fooled, and we may be chasing a straw
man in a paper boat right at this minute, sir.
Yet, if Dalton were out on the water, with his
stolen papers, he&#8217;d want to get nowhere else but
to Brazil. If he isn&#8217;t on the water, then he&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
not trying this route to your Brazilian enemies,
and we might as well be out here as on Lonely
Island.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the boat in the lead neared the coast Halstead
again kept the marine glass to his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a little river over yonder,&#8221; he observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I know the stream. Hardly more than
a creek,&#8221; replied Mr. Seaton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any deep water there, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For only a very little way in. Then the
stream moves over a pebbly bottom like a running
brook.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it looks, sir, as though Lemly&mdash;if he&#8217;s
aboard&mdash;plans to run in there and hustle
ashore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or else stay and fight,&#8221; hinted Powell Seaton.
&#8220;The place is lonely enough for a fight, if
the rascals dare try it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hepton!&#8221; summoned Halstead, a few moments
later. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think you&#8217;d better get
up your rifle? You don&#8217;t need to show it, but
someone may send us a shot or two from the
drab boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hepton sprang below, bringing up both rifles.
Crouching behind the forward deck-house, he
examined the magazines of both weapons.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re carrying load enough for a squad o&#8217;
infantry,&#8221; laughed Hepton, showing his strong,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
white teeth. &#8220;Let those fellers on the Drab try
it, if they want to see what we&#8217;ve got.&#8221;</p>
<p>The seventy-footer was shutting off speed
now, going slowly into the mouth of the little
river. Almost immediately afterwards her reverse
was applied, after which she swung at
anchor.</p>
<p>Tom, too, without a word to Hank, who stood
by the wheel, reached over, slowing the &#8220;Restless&#8221;
down to a gait of something like eight
miles an hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the order, sir?&#8221; he asked, turning
to Mr. Seaton. &#8220;Are we to go in and anchor
alongside?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t want to run you young men into
any too dangerous places,&#8221; began Powell Seaton,
hesitatingly. &#8220;I&mdash;I&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Danger&#8217;s one of the things we&#8217;re paid for,&#8221;
clicked Tom Halstead, softly. &#8220;It&#8217;ll all in the
charter. Do you want to go in alongside?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The shot came so unexpectedly that the motor
boat boys jumped despite themselves. Hepton
cocked one of the rifles, and was about to
rise with it, when the young skipper of the
&#8220;Restless&#8221; prodded the man gently with one
foot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t show your guns, Hepton,&#8221; murmured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
Tom. &#8220;Wait until we find out what that shot
was meant for.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one now appeared on board the drab
seventy-footer. There had been no smoke, no
whistle of a bullet by the heads of those on the
bridge deck of the &#8220;Restless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was intended only to make us nervous,&#8221;
grinned Captain Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or else to show us that they have fire-arms,&#8221;
suggested Seaton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, I&#8217;m headed to go in alongside,
unless you give me other orders,&#8221; hinted the
young skipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cover about half the rest of the distance,
then reverse and lie to,&#8221; decided Powell Seaton.
He now had the extra pair of marine glasses,
and was attentively studying both the boat and
the shore nearby.</p>
<p>Tom took the wheel himself, stopping where
he had been directed. So neatly was headway
corrected that the &#8220;Restless&#8221; barely drifted
on the smooth water inshore.</p>
<p>There was now remaining less than an hour
of daylight.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I understand their plan, if Dalton
is on board,&#8221; whispered Mr. Seaton to his
young captain. &#8220;Dalton is waiting until it is
dark enough to slip ashore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! There&#8217;s one way you <i>could</i> stop that,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
if you want to take all the risk,&#8221; ventured Halstead,
grinning thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if it&#8217;s the plan of anyone aboard the
drab boat to slip on shore under cover of darkness,
then I could put our tender overboard and
row Hepton to one bank of the river with his
rifle. Returning, I could row you to the other
shore, you to carry the other rifle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be a bold and open move,&#8221;
agreed Mr. Seaton, gasping at first, then looking
thoughtful. &#8220;But look at that shore, Halstead.
See the thick trees on either bank of the
river. Hepton and I couldn&#8217;t watch a lot of
stretch on both banks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With our help from the boat you could, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Again, how?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s shallow enough to drop anchor
right here, Mr. Seaton. Then, as soon as it
grows the least bit dark, we boys could keep
our searchlight turned on the drab boat so that
you and Hepton could see every movement on
her decks. From a quarter of a mile off you
could see anyone swimming ashore and run to
stop him. There&#8217;s no difficulty about it, sir,
except the risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hepton, I must talk that over with you,&#8221;
cried Powell Seaton. &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel that I have
any right to run you into too certain danger.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>But Hepton smiled again in a way to show his
white teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry &#8217;bout me, Mr. Seaton. I feel
big &#8217;nough to take care of myself, and I enlisted
for the whole game, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could keep watch right from this deck,&#8221;
Halstead added. &#8220;But then, if anyone slipped
ashore from the Drab, you couldn&#8217;t get on shore
fast enough to follow through the woods. You&#8217;d
lose the trail right after the start.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if I were on shore, and Dalton walked
right by me, what could I do?&#8221; pondered Powell
Seaton. &#8220;Of course, I know the sheriff of the
county would take him, for going aboard this
boat and breaking it loose from the dock the
other night. A United States marshal might
arrest Dalton, on my request, for piracy in
sailing away with the boat. But would I have
a right to seize Dalton and hold him&mdash;even if
able?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can follow him until you <i>do</i> run Dalton
into one of the law&#8217;s officers,&#8221; proposed
Halstead.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I&#8217;m going ashore, anyway, to see
what happens,&#8221; announced Mr. Seaton, after
giving the matter a little more thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;But let me go ashore, first, on the other
bank,&#8221; begged Hepton. &#8220;Then you can take
second chance, sir.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very good, then,&#8221; agreed the charter-man.</p>
<p>With the aid of his mates, Captain Tom had
the anchor overboard, and the small tender
alongside in a jiffy. Hepton stepped down into
the smaller craft, carrying his rifle so that it
could be seen. Tom himself took the oars to
row.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d better put you in on the bank to the
left,&#8221; whispered Halstead, and Hepton nodded.</p>
<p>They passed within forty yards of the stern
of the drab boat, yet not a single human being
appeared on that mysterious craft.</p>
<p>Having put Hepton on shore, Halstead rowed
back for Mr. Seaton. Embarking this second
passenger, Tom, this time, rowed a little closer
to the seventy-footer lying at anchor in the
river&#8217;s mouth. Now, the head of a man unknown
to either of them showed aft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where you-all goin&#8217; with so many guns?&#8221;
this man asked, in a half-jeering tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Night hunting,&#8221; retorted Tom, dryly, not
feeling guilty of a lie since he was certain the
other would not believe him.</p>
<p>Landing Mr. Seaton on the other river bank,
the young captain of the &#8220;Restless&#8221; returned
to his craft.</p>
<p>By now it was nearly dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;We may as well see how the searchlight is
working,&#8221; Joe Dawson suggested.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Turn it on them, and sweep it around,&#8221; responded
Halstead.</p>
<p>The strong glare of light was found to be
working satisfactorily. Dark came on quickly,
still without any more signs of life aboard the
Drab than had already been observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Supper time, surely,&#8221; announced Hank, in
a glum voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother about that to-night,&#8221; objected
the young skipper. &#8220;Slip down into the galley
and make sandwiches enough for all hands.
We can eat and watch&mdash;<i>must</i>, in fact, if we eat
at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the sandwiches had been made and disposed
of the Motor Boat Club boys began to find
the swinging of the light on the drab boat, on
the water and on either river bank, to be growing
rather monotonous.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish something would happen,&#8221; grumbled
Hank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t start a fuss about that,&#8221; yawned
Joe. &#8220;Something is likely enough to start up
at any second.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It has started,&#8221; whispered Tom Halstead,
swinging the searchlight, just then, across the
Drab&#8217;s hull. &#8220;Look there!&#8221;</p>
<p>Two much-muffled figures, looking nearly
identical, and each of the pair carrying a bag,
appeared on deck amidships, one standing on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
each side of the deck-house. Then, as quickly,
by their sides stood two other men who sprang
to lower the two small boats that hung at
davits. One muffled man and one helper embarked
in each boat, the helper in each case
rowing swiftly to either bank of the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a queer game, but a clever one,&#8221;
muttered Captain Tom, swinging the glaring
searchlight and watching.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll mix up Mr. Seaton and Hepton all
right,&#8221; grimaced Joe Dawson. &#8220;Each will
wonder whether <i>he</i> has Dalton on his side of
the river, to follow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, as quickly, the two boat-tenders rowed
back to the Drab, and the boats were triced up
in a twinkling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, they&#8217;ve got their anchor up!&#8221; cried
Hank Butts, in a breathless undertone.
&#8220;They&#8217;re going to scoot out on us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m ready to bet,&#8221; muttered Tom Halstead,
&#8220;that neither of the muffled men that went
ashore was Anson Dalton. They must be trying
to throw our crowd off the trail, and now
that seventy-footer is trying to get off with
Dalton still aboard!&#8221;</p>
<p>Whatever the plan was, the Drab was now
backing out of the river mouth and swinging
around. So far none of her sailing lights were
in evidence. She looked more like a pirate craft
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
slinking out into the night on an errand of dire
mischief.</p>
<p>Once out of the mouth of the river, the Drab
swung around, then began to move ahead. By
this time her prow was head-on for the &#8220;Restless,&#8221;
as though aimed to strike the latter craft
amidships.</p>
<p>Then, as the Drab&#8217;s speed increased, Tom
Halstead vented excitedly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Jupiter! They&#8217;re out to cut us in two while
we ride here at anchor!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>TOM HALSTEAD&mdash;READY!</h3>
</div>
<p>There was no time to raise the anchor.
Even had this been possible, it would
have been out of the question to get the
motors started and running in time to get out
of the Drab&#8217;s way.</p>
<p>Captain Tom Halstead was taken wholly by
surprise, yet he was not caught with his wits
asleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make a dive for those sticks, fellows!&#8221; he
shouted, bounding for the motor room hatchway.
&#8220;If we get a chance we&#8217;ll give &#8217;em at
least a pat for a blow!&#8221;</p>
<p>The sticks of firewood that they had used on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
the night of their long swim were in the motor
room. Tom caught up his, wheeling to bound
outside again. Joe Dawson was barely a step
behind him.</p>
<p>But Hank&mdash;he went as though by instinct for
the hitching weight that had already made him
famous in the annals of the Motor Boat Club.</p>
<p>Swift as they were, the trio were back on
deck just in time to witness the final man&oelig;uvre
of the seventy-footer. That craft, not moving
very fast, suddenly veered in its course.</p>
<p>Instead of cutting through the &#8220;Restless,&#8221;
the larger motor boat swung suddenly so as to
come up alongside, rail to rail. And now the
whole intention was manifest at a glance, for
the figures of six men, with their caps pulled
well down over their eyes, appeared at the
Drab&#8217;s rail.</p>
<p>&#8220;All hands to repel boarders!&#8221; sang out Captain
Tom Halstead, his voice ringing defiantly.
&#8220;Show &#8217;em the best you can!&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe swung, with a single-stick trick he had
learned and practiced. It was a feint, aimed at
the first of the Drab&#8217;s crew to try to leap
aboard. The intended victim threw up his
hands to ward off the blow from the top of his
head, but he received, instead, a stinging, crushing
slap across the face.</p>
<p>Tom thrust one end of his stick for the face
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
of another of the boarding strangers. The fellow
strove to protect his face, and would have
guarded easily enough, but, instead, the other
end of Tom&#8217;s bludgeon struck him in the pit of
his stomach, depriving him of all his wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Woof!&#8221; grunted Hank, at the first sign of
onslaught.</p>
<p>In both hands he clutched that business-like,
though not formidable looking, hitching weight.
One man set his foot on deck. Hank, almost
with deliberation, dropped the weight on the
toes of that foot.</p>
<p>There was a yell of pain. Snatching up the
weight instantly, Hank let it fly forward and
fall across the toes of another of the boarders.</p>
<p>Two of the strangers were limping now. Another
was nursing an injured face, from Joe&#8217;s
heavy blow. Captain Tom&#8217;s victim had fallen
back aboard his home craft, gasping for breath.</p>
<p>The other two of the invaders got aboard the
&#8220;Restless&#8221;&mdash;then wished they hadn&#8217;t, for Hank
pursued one of them with his terrifying hitching
weight, while Tom and Joe divided the sole remaining
enemy between them.</p>
<p>Hardly had the affair begun when it ended;
it was all over in an instant. The two who had
escaped injury leaped back aboard the Drab.
Those who needed assistance were helped back.
The Drab drifted away, her vagrant course
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
unheeded at first, for it looked as though all aboard
had taken part in that disastrous boarding enterprise.</p>
<p>Tom and Hank sprang for their own anchor,
while Joe, as soon as he saw the big motor boats
drift apart, dropped into the small boat of the
&#8220;Restless&#8221; and rowed swiftly for shore.
Hardly had he touched the beach when
Powell Seaton, rifle in hand, bounded forth
from cover.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put across, and see if we can get Hepton,
too,&#8221; directed the charter-man, in a low voice.
&#8220;I stepped right up out of the bushes, almost
into the face of the fellow who landed on my
side of the river. It was neither Dalton nor
Lemly. As soon as the fellow saw me he
laughed, put a chew of tobacco in his mouth,
and went on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardly had Seaton finished speaking when
Joe Dawson shot the bow of the little boat
against the further bank. During this time Mr.
Seaton had kept his eyes on the drab boat,
holding his rifle in readiness in case another
effort should be made to ram or board the
&#8220;Restless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you-u-u-u!&#8221; called Joe, hailing. There
was a sound in the woods, and then Hepton
came into sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see the man who landed on your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
side?&#8221; whispered Powell Seaton, as Hepton
reached the beach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he was just an ordinary roustabout
chap,&#8221; grunted Hepton, disgustedly. &#8220;I had
no orders to follow <i>him</i>, so I didn&#8217;t take the
trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Jump in and we&#8217;ll get aboard
the &#8216;Restless.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hank had the motors working long before Joe
returned with his two passengers, and was
standing by. Captain Tom was at the wheel, but
keeping the searchlight inquisitively on the
Drab.</p>
<p>Now, the seventy-footer began to move off
slowly down the coast, going at a speed of perhaps
six miles an hour. Halstead, without waiting
for orders, went in chase, keeping his place
two hundred yards behind the other craft. All
the while he kept the searchlight swinging over
the Drab, from her port to starboard sides.</p>
<p>&#8220;That must annoy those fellows,&#8221; observed
Powell Seaton, with a chuckle, as he stood by
the young skipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon it does,&#8221; returned Tom, dryly.
&#8220;But it also prevents their letting anyone off
the boat without our seeing it. You see, sir,
they&#8217;re only about a quarter of a mile off the
coast here. Their small boat could make a
quick dash for the shore. Even a good swimmer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
could go overboard. I don&#8217;t intend to let
anyone get off that seventy-footer without our
knowing all about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Halstead had not been silent long when he
saw a bright flash from the Drab, aft. It was
followed, almost immediately, by the sound of
a gun. Then a bullet went by about two feet
over their heads.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was meant for our searchlight,&#8221;
laughed Tom Halstead, coolly. &#8220;Those fellows
want to put it out of business.&#8221;</p>
<p>With an ugly cry Hepton leaned over the
edge of the forward deck-house, sighting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that,&#8221; called Captain Tom, sharply.
Then he added: &#8220;I beg your pardon, Mr. Seaton,
but I don&#8217;t believe you want any shooting to
come from us unless it&#8217;s necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; replied the charter-man,
thoughtfully. &#8220;Dalton and Lemly seem willing
to take desperate chances, acting like pirates,
in fact. But we don&#8217;t want to kill anyone, and,
above all, we want to be very sure we have the
law on our side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They fired our way,&#8221; urged Hepton, rather
stubbornly. &#8220;We have a right to defend ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they sent only one shot,&#8221; replied Seaton.
&#8220;They might afterwards claim that it was an
accidental discharge. Unless they make it very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
plain that they&#8217;re playing the part of pirates,
we&#8217;d better take the best of care not to put ourselves
wrong before the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, sir,&#8221; admitted Hepton.
&#8220;But, while I&#8217;m willing to take any chances
that go with my job, it doesn&#8217;t seem just fair
to ask me to be exposed to bullets from that
other boat without the right to answer their
fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can get down before the forward deck-house,
Hepton,&#8221; nodded Halstead, pleasantly.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t be hit through the deck-house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can be hit, fine,&#8221; objected Hepton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like Mr. Seaton,&#8221; answered the young skipper,
&#8220;I&#8217;d rather take the chance than do anything
to put us in the wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grumbling a bit, though under his breath,
Hepton seated himself where the forward deck-house
would protect him. Joe remained leaning
nonchalantly over the edge of the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if they <i>will</i> dare to keep up a fusillade?&#8221;
he presently said, watching the deck of
the drab boat in the glare of light that Halstead
now held steadily on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they fire another shot at us,&#8221; replied
Powell Seaton, &#8220;then Hepton and I will crouch
over the forward deck-house, rifles ready, and
fire at the flash of the third shot. We&#8217;ll keep
within the law, but we won&#8217;t stand for any determined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
piracy that we have the power to
resist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take the wheel, Hank,&#8221; called Tom, presently.
Then the young skipper signed to his
employer that he wanted to speak with him
aft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Seaton,&#8221; began Tom, &#8220;I want to ask
you a few questions, with a view to making a
suggestion that may be worth while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead, Halstead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You trust me now, fully? Have you gotten
wholly over your suspicions of early this afternoon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Halstead,&#8221; replied the charter-man, in a
tone uneasy with emotion, &#8220;I&#8217;m wholly ashamed
of anything that I may have said or thought.
You&#8217;ve shown me, since, how perfectly brave
you are. I don&#8217;t believe a young man with your
cool, resolute grit, and your clear head, <i>could</i>
be anything but absolutely honest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; acknowledged the young motor
boat captain. &#8220;Now, Mr. Seaton, though the
two sets of papers describing and locating your
diamond field are out of your hands, don&#8217;t you
remember the contents of the papers well enough
to sit down at a desk and duplicate them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; surely,&#8221; nodded Mr. Seaton, slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You feel certain that you can seat yourself
and write out a set of papers that would tell a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
man down in Brazil just how to locate the diamond
field?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can, Halstead. It would be a matter of
some hours of writing, that&#8217;s all. But why are
you asking this? What plan have you in your
mind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got a hunch, sir,&#8221; replied Tom
Halstead, quietly, &#8220;that you&#8217;re never going to
see the lost papers again. If Anson Dalton
found you getting close to him, and knew you
could seize the papers, he&#8217;d destroy them. It
seems to me that our sole game must be to prevent
his ever getting those papers to Brazil
ahead of a second set that you can just as well
write to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we trail him all the time,&#8221; replied Powell
Seaton, thoughtfully, &#8220;we can know whether
the fellow succeeds in getting away on a ship to
Brazil. He can&#8217;t go on that drab boat ahead,
can he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The seventy-footer would be quite good
enough a boat to make the voyage to Brazil,&#8221;
Halstead answered. &#8220;So would the &#8216;Restless,&#8217;
for that matter. The only trouble would be that
neither boat could carry anywhere near enough
gasoline for such a voyage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Anson Dalton, if he gets away to
Brazil, will have to board some regular
liner or freighter? Well, as long as we keep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
him in sight, we&#8217;ll know whether he&#8217;s doing
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Dalton will get desperate,&#8221; Tom
warned his employer. &#8220;While holding onto the
papers he has succeeded in obtaining, he can
make a copy, and he may very likely determine
to send the copies to your old enemy, Terrero,
by mail. Now, Mr. Seaton, it seems to me that
your best hope is to duplicate the missing papers
at once, and, if you can&#8217;t find in haste a messenger
you&#8217;ll trust, then you had better send
the papers by registered mail to your friends
in Rio Janeiro.&#8221;</p>
<p>Powell Seaton stared at the young skipper,
going deathly pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Halstead, don&#8217;t you understand
that the possession of such a set of papers, at
Rio Janeiro, would mean that the possessor
could locate and file a patent to the diamond
field, of which no one, save myself, at present
knows the exact location? Why, even if the
postal authorities do their very best to put the
papers in the proper hands, anyone like a dishonest
clerk might get the papers in his hands.
The temptation would be powerful for anyone
who had the papers to locate the mine at once
for himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand, fully,&#8221; agreed Captain Tom.
&#8220;But the whole thing has become a desperate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
case, now, and some desperate chances must be
taken if you&#8217;re to have a good chance to win
out against Terrero and his crooked friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&mdash;you&mdash;honestly believe I&#8217;d better
make out another set of papers and mail them to
my friends of the syndicate, at Rio Janeiro?&#8221;
faltered Mr. Seaton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; unless you prefer to be almost certain
of losing your fight for the great fortune.
For Dalton, of course, knows that you can send
a set of the papers by mail. He&#8217;ll feel like taking
the same desperate chance in order to have
a better chance of getting in ahead of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By mail&mdash;even registered mail?&#8221; groaned
Mr. Seaton. &#8220;It seems an awful&mdash;desperate
chance to take. Yet&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Prepare a duplicate set of the papers,&#8221;
proposed Tom Halstead, &#8220;and, if you&#8217;ll trust
me, I&#8217;ll board the first Rio-bound steamer that
we meet, and go through for you. I&#8217;ll give you
every guarantee that&#8217;s possible to find your
people in Rio and turn the papers over to
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you?&#8221; demanded Seaton, peering
eagerly into his young skipper&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll trust me to go as your messenger
to Rio?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, in a minute, Halstead! Yet I&#8217;m thinking
of the great danger you&#8217;d be running. At
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
this moment Terrero&#8217;s spies must be plentiful in
Rio Janeiro. Why, even every steamer that
leaves New York for Brazil may carry his men
aboard, alert, watchful and deadly. You don&#8217;t
know what a man like Terrero is like. The
constant danger to you&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Constant danger,&#8221; laughed Tom Halstead,
softly, &#8220;is something that most men learn
readily to face. Otherwise, wars would be impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that is very different,&#8221; retorted Powell
Seaton, quickly. &#8220;In war men have the constant
elbow-touch, the presence and support of
comrades. But you would be alone&mdash;one
against hundreds, perhaps, at the very instant
when you set foot ashore in Brazil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take the chance, if you let me,&#8221; declared
Captain Tom. &#8220;But, now, sir, you&#8217;re
losing time. Why don&#8217;t you go below, get writing
materials, and start in earnest to get out the
duplicate papers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; nodded the charter-man. &#8220;Should
I change my mind, it will be easy enough to
burn the sheets after I have written them.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Powell Seaton turned to go down into the
cabin Joe Dawson called sharply:</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom, something&#8217;s up ahead! Come here,
quickly!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>GRIT GOES UP THE SIGNAL MAST</h3>
</div>
<p>Even before Captain Tom turned he heard
the sudden throb of the twin screws of
the propellers, and felt the speed being
reversed. That told him, instantly, that Joe had
found some reason for stopping the &#8220;Restless&#8221;
in a hurry.</p>
<p>As the young commander bounded forward
the steady ray of his own searchlight showed
him that the seventy-footer had also stopped
her headway.</p>
<p>Hank was still at the wheel, but young Dawson
was beside him on the bridge deck.</p>
<p>&#8220;There they go&mdash;dropping their anchor overboard,&#8221;
cried Joe, pointing. &#8220;The water&#8217;s shallow
along this coast, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll move right in, between that boat and
the shore, and drop anchor, too,&#8221; decided Captain
Halstead, taking the wheel and reaching
for the engine control. He sent the &#8220;Restless&#8221;
slowly forward into place, then shut off headway,
ordering:</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe, you and Hank get our anchor over.
Dalton can&#8217;t get anything or anybody ashore,
now, without our knowing it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But what can his plan be, anchoring on an
open coast?&#8221; demanded young Dawson, as he
came back from heaving the anchor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our job is just to wait and see,&#8221; laughed
Captain Halstead.</p>
<p>Mr. Seaton came on deck again, to learn what
this sudden stopping of the boat meant.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s some trick, and all we can do is to
watch it, sir,&#8221; reported the young skipper of
the &#8220;Restless,&#8221; pointing to the anchored Drab.
&#8220;Yet I think the whole situation, sir, points to
the necessity for your taking my recent advice
and acting on it without the loss of an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Either the registered mail, or yourself
as a special messenger,&#8221; whispered Seaton,
hoarsely, in the boy&#8217;s ear. &#8220;Yes, yes! I&#8217;ll fly
at the work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t hurry back below, though,&#8221; advised
Halstead. &#8220;Stroll along, as though you were
going below for a nap. A night glass on the
seventy-footer is undoubtedly watching all our
movements.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the two boats swung idly at anchor, on that
smooth sea, their bows lay some three hundred
yards apart. The night air was so still, and
voices carried so far, that those on the deck of
the &#8220;Restless&#8221; were obliged to speak very
quietly.</p>
<p>Over on the seventy-footer but one human
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
being showed himself to the watchers on the
smaller boat. This solitary individual paced
the drab boat&#8217;s bridge deck, puffing at a short-stemmed
pipe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d give a lot to be smart enough to guess
what their game is,&#8221; whispered Joe, curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a puzzle,&#8221; sighed Captain Tom Halstead.
&#8220;It looks, now, as though Dalton and
Lemly are trying to hold us here while someone
else does something on shore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you think the two who landed on
either bank of the river&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that neither of them was Dalton
or Lemly, but I&#8217;m beginning to suspect that one,
or both, of those fellows carried messages,
somewhere and of some nature. In that case,
we&#8217;re letting our curiosity hold us up here while
the enemy are accomplishing something at some
other point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Confound &#8217;em!&#8221; growled Joe, prodding the
bulwarks with his toe. &#8220;They&#8217;re clever rascals!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanwhile,&#8221; whispered Tom, &#8220;I&#8217;ve just
been thinking of something else that we ought
to be doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There may be another steamship for Rio Janeiro
passing somewhere in these waters at
any time. We ought to send out a call on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
wireless at least once an hour. There&#8217;s something
else in the wind, old fellow, and we <i>do</i>
want to know when the first steam vessel for
Rio passes through these waters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll go below and get at work at the
sending key,&#8221; proposed Dawson. &#8220;Send out
the wireless call once an hour, you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; yet we don&#8217;t want to forget that we&#8217;re
being watched all the time from that old drab
pirate yonder. Don&#8217;t let the enemy see you
going to the cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll drop down into the motor room and use
the passageway through.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dawson was gone ten minutes. When he returned
he shook his head, then stood looking
out over the sea. Excepting the &#8220;Restless&#8221;
and the drab seventy-footer there was no craft
in sight. Not so much as a lighthouse shed its
beams over the ocean at this point of the coast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, it&#8217;s weird, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; muttered Joe
Dawson. &#8220;We can&#8217;t see a thing but ourselves,
yet down in the cabin I&#8217;ve just been chatting
with the Savannah boat, the New Orleans boat,
two Boston fruit steamers, the southbound
Havana liner and a British warship. Look out
there. Where are they? Yet all are within
reach of my electric wave!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no longer any pathless roads of
the sea&mdash;not since the wireless came in,&#8221; declared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
Tom Halstead. &#8220;If there were enough
vessels to relay us we could talk direct with
London now. The next thing will be a telephone
in every stateroom, with a wireless central on
the saloon deck or the spar deck. But gracious!
We&#8217;ve been forgetting all about our poor
prisoner in the starboard stateroom. He must
have a royal case of hunger by now. Tell Hank
to take him in some food and to feed the poor
fellow, since he can&#8217;t use his own hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later time began to drag by. There were
few signs of life aboard the seventy-footer.
Sending Joe and Hepton down to the motor
room berths as watch below, Tom kept Hank
on deck with him. Bye-and-bye Joe and Hepton
took their trick on deck, while Halstead and
Hank Butts went below for some sleep.
Through most of the night Powell Seaton remained
hard at work over his writing, often
pausing to read and make some corrections.</p>
<p>Morning found the two boats still at anchor.
With sunrise came a stiffer wind that rocked
the &#8220;Restless&#8221; a good deal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, look out for one of the sudden September
gales,&#8221; warned Captain Tom Halstead,
as, after the second short sleep of the night,
he came up on deck, yawning and stretching.
He stepped over to read the barometer, then
turned quickly to Joe.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like something&#8217;s going to happen,
doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; queried Dawson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; there&#8217;s a disturbance heading this
way,&#8221; admitted Tom, looking around at the
sky. &#8220;Yet it may be hours, or a day, off yet.
If we were going under canvas, though, I&#8217;d
shorten it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The captain of the Drab evidently believes
in being prepared,&#8221; hinted Joe, nodding in the
direction of the other craft. Two men were now
visible on the deck of the seventy-footer. They
were taking up anchor, though not doing it with
either speed or stealth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we have to take our sailing
orders from them,&#8221; nodded the young skipper.
&#8220;You&#8217;d better get the motors on the mote, Joe.
I&#8217;ll have Hank and Hepton help me up with
our anchor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon afterwards the Drab was heading north
at a ten-mile gait; half a minute later the &#8220;Restless&#8221;
started in leisurely pursuit.</p>
<p>After half an hour or so the Drab headed into
another open roadstead, anchoring a quarter of
a mile from shore. Tom dropped anchor some
three hundred yards to the southward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep your eye seaward, Hank,&#8221; directed
the young skipper. &#8220;Joe, if you&#8217;ll see whether
Mr. Seaton wants anything, Hepton and I will
keep a keen eye on the shore.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Seaton is asleep in the port stateroom,&#8221;
Dawson reported back a moment later. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
made eight calls through the night, but I&#8217;ll get
at the sending key again, and see whether there&#8217;s
anything in our line within hail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardly had Joe Dawson vanished below when
Skipper Tom uttered a sudden exclamation. A
sharp, bright glint of light from under the trees
on shore caught his watchful eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look there!&#8221; the young captain called,
pointing to the flash.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another,&#8221; muttered Hank Butts,
pointing further up the coast.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jimminy, there&#8217;s a third,&#8221; cried Hepton,
pointing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Signals for the Dalton-Lemly crew,&#8221; uttered
Tom, disgustedly. &#8220;<i>They</i> are getting
news, now, and of a kind we can&#8217;t read. Hank!
Call Mr. Seaton. <i>He</i> ought to be on deck, watching
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The charter-man was speedily up into the
open.</p>
<p>In the meantime Joe, at the powerful sending
apparatus below, sent the spark leaping across
the spark-gap, and, dashing up the aerials, there
shot into space the electric waves intended to be
gathered in by any other wireless operator
within fifty or sixty miles.</p>
<p>Crash-sh! Ass-ss-ssh! hissed the spark,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
bounding, leaping to its work like a thing of
almost animal life.</p>
<p>Bang! This last note that came on the air
was sharp, clear, though not loud. Whew-ew!
A bullet uttered a swift sigh as it sped past the
signaling mast twenty feet over the heads of
the watchers of the &#8220;Restless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Confound it! Rascals on shore are shooting
at us,&#8221; exclaimed Powell Seaton, turning swiftly
to peer at the forest-clad shore line.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; they&#8217;re shooting at our aerials!&#8221; retorted
Captain Tom Halstead.</p>
<p>Bang! Whe-ew-ew! Clash! Then there was
a metallic clash, for the second rifle shot from
the land had scored a fair bull&#8217;s-eye among the
clustered aerial wires. There was a rattle, and
some of the severed wire ends hung down.</p>
<p>With an ugly grunt, Hepton bounded down
into the motor room, passing up the two rifles.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must be careful, though,&#8221; warned Mr.
Seaton. &#8220;This time they&#8217;re not shooting at
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Load and be ready, though!&#8221; uttered Captain
Tom, dryly. &#8220;They soon will be shooting
at us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several more shots clattered out, and two
more of the bullets did further damage among
the aerial wires. Then Joe came dancing up on
deck, his eyes full of ire.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The infernal scoundrels have put our spark
out of business,&#8221; he cried, disgustedly. &#8220;We
haven&#8217;t wire enough left to send five miles.
Where do the shots come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From the shore,&#8221; Halstead replied, &#8220;but see
for yourself if you can locate the marksmen.
We can&#8217;t. They&#8217;re using smokeless powder,
and are hidden so far in under the trees that
we can&#8217;t even make out the flashes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s out of my line to locate them,&#8221; announced
Joe Dawson, with vigor. &#8220;It&#8217;s mine to
see that the aerials are put on a working basis
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>He vanished, briefly, into the motor room,
soon reappearing with a coil of wire and miscellaneous
tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; commended Halstead, joyously.
&#8220;Mr. Seaton, we have wire enough to repair a
dozen smashes, if need be. On up with you,
Joe. I&#8217;m at your heels.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe started to climb the mast, using the
slightly projecting footholds placed there for
that purpose. Tom let him get a clear lead,
then started up after his chum.</p>
<p>From the shore broke out a rapid, intermittent
volley. Steel-clad bullets sang a song full
of menace about that signal mast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come down, boys! You&#8217;ll be killed!&#8221;
roared Mr. Seaton, looking up apprehensively.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>While Joe kept on climbing, in silence, Skipper
Tom looked down with a cool grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Killed?&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Well, if we&#8217;re not,
we&#8217;ll fix the aerials. We can&#8217;t allow strangers
to put us out of business!&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe found his place to go to work. Tom
halted, with his head on a level with his chum&#8217;s
knees. From the shore there came another
burst of rifle-fire, and the air about them was
sternly melodious with the pest-laden hum of
bullets. Two of the missiles glancingly struck
wires just above Dawson&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>In the lull that followed Joe&#8217;s voice was
heard:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold the wire, Tom. Pass me the pliers.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>PLAYING SALT WATER BLIND MAN&#8217;S BUFF</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to do something!&#8221; growled Hepton,
his teeth tightly shut.</p>
<p>Raising his rifle to his shoulder, making
his guess by sound, the man let two shots
drive at the shore, not far back from the beach&#8217;s
edge. Then, after a pause and a long look, he
let three more shots drive, slightly changing his
sighting each time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Mr. Seaton,&#8221; he urged. &#8220;They&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
firing on your skipper and engineer this time.
It&#8217;s up to us to answer &#8217;em&mdash;clear case of self-preservation.
The first <i>law</i> that was ever invented!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bang! bang! rang Seaton&#8217;s rifle, twice. He,
too, fired for the forest, near the beach. It
was like the man to hope he had hit no
one, but he was determined to stop if possible
this direct attack on Tom Halstead and Joe
Dawson.</p>
<p>Evidently the first sign of resistance was not
to stop the bothering tactics of those on shore,
for one wire that Joe was handling was zipped
out of his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;They mean business, the enemy,&#8221; called
down Skipper Tom, softly, to the tune of a low
laugh. &#8220;But we&#8217;ll get rigged, in spite of them.
All we ask for is that they let us get the wire
fixed often enough for a few minutes of sending
and receiving once an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hepton and his employer continued to fire,
using a good deal of ammunition. The guard
was much more vengeful in his firing and in his
attempts to locate the hidden marksmen than
was Seaton.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what those two men went ashore for
last night,&#8221; called down Halstead, quietly.
&#8220;First of all, to fool us and get us guessing,
and, next, to hunt up some of their own rascals
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
for this work. The seventy-footer led us into
this trap on purpose. Finely done, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It shows,&#8221; retorted Mr. Seaton, wrathily,
&#8220;that along this sparsely settled shore there is
a numerous gang organized for some law-breaking
purpose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Smuggling, most likely,&#8221; guessed Tom.
&#8220;And it must pay unusually well, too, for
them to have such a big and so well-armed a
crew.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three more shots sounded from the shore.
All of the trio of bullets went uncomfortably
close to the young skipper and engineer, though
doing no actual damage. Hepton, with his ear
trained to catch the direction of the discharge
sounds, changed his guess, firing in a new direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, it&#8217;s done, until it&#8217;s put out of business
again,&#8221; muttered Joe, finally. &#8220;Slide,
Tom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Almost immediately after Dawson disappeared
the crash of the spark across the spark-gap
and up the wires was heard. The young
wireless operator of the &#8220;Restless&#8221; was making
the most of any time that might be left to
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about that storm that threatened last
night, captain?&#8221; inquired Mr. Seaton. &#8220;Has it
come any nearer?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></div>

&#8220;There, It&#8217;s Done,&#8221; Muttered Joe. &#8220;Slide, Tom.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; replied the motor boat captain,
shaking his head. &#8220;It acted the way many September
storms do on this coast. It passed by us,
out to sea, and ought to be down by Havana by
now. The barometer has been rising, and is at
nearly the usual pressure. But I don&#8217;t like the
looks of the sky over there&#8221;&mdash;pointing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; queried the charter-man, following
the gesture with his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be playing in great luck, sir,&#8221; answered
the young captain, &#8220;if a fog doesn&#8217;t roll
in where the storm threatened to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fog?&#8221; Mr. Seaton&#8217;s tone had an aghast
ring to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure, Captain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. It&#8217;s only a possibility, but a good
one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hepton was making his rifle bark again, deep,
snappy and angry in its throat, in answer to a
challenge from shore, but Powell Seaton stood
surveying the weather with a look of deepest
concern.</p>
<p>Then he turned to regard the drab seventy-footer
at anchor near by.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be the enemy&#8217;s real chance,
wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what I dread, sir,&#8221; Captain Tom admitted.
&#8220;Let us be wrapped in a thick bank of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
fog, and the Drab would be out of our vision
and hearing in a very short time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shades of hard luck!&#8221; groaned the charter-man,
growing pallid.</p>
<p>Off on the seaward horizon an indefinite haze
was soon observable. To the untrained eye it
didn&#8217;t look like much. Though Mr. Seaton
spoke of it, he didn&#8217;t appear much concerned.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be a pity to bother him until the time
comes when he throbs with worry,&#8221; thought
Captain Tom Halstead, sympathetically. &#8220;But
if that low-hanging haze doesn&#8217;t spell
t-r-o-u-b-l-e, then I&#8217;ve been raised among a different
breed of sea fogs!&#8221;</p>
<p>The crashing of sparks over the spark-gap
had ceased for the present, and Joe, reporting
that there was no wireless craft within reach of
his limited aerials, was on deck once more,
waiting until the time should come around for
another trial.</p>
<p>Hank had gone below to start the motors, connecting
them with the dynamo, to renew the
supply of electrical &#8220;juice&#8221; in the storage batteries,
which was running low, as proved by
the last message sent.</p>
<p>The chug-chug of the twin motors was heard
over on the seventy-footer, and soon an unknown
man, his cap pulled well down over his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
eyes, appeared at the stern of the Drab. He
took a long, keen look at the &#8220;Restless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s wondering if we&#8217;re going to hoist the
mud-hook,&#8221; smiled Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;And hoping that we are,&#8221; grinned Joe.
&#8220;Oh, but we must be an eyesore to those wistful
scoundrels!&#8221;</p>
<p>Powell Seaton now spent most of his time
gazing at the line of haze, which, by degrees,
was growing bigger and coming nearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Halstead,&#8221; he faltered, &#8220;I&#8217;m beginning
to feel certain that you&#8217;re a prophet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or a Jonah?&#8221; laughed Tom, though it was
not a very cheerful sort of laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, no!&#8221; cried the charter-man, earnestly.
&#8220;Never that! The little luck that I&#8217;ve
had in these trying days has all come through
you youngsters. Without you I&#8217;d have been flat
on my back in the fearful game that I&#8217;m playing
with such desperate hopefulness against hope.
But I see our fog is coming in as a sure thing.
If it envelops us, what can you do with regard
to that drab-tinted sea-monster over
yonder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It depends upon the depth and duration of
the fog, sir,&#8221; Halstead answered. &#8220;We have
our motors going. At the first strong sign of
our getting hemmed in by it we&#8217;ll lift our mud-hook
[the anchor] and move in closer. If the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
fog isn&#8217;t too thick we may be able to take up a
position where we can at least observe her
dimly. If she starts to pull out into a fog-bank,
we&#8217;ll follow at her heels, keeping as close as
necessary to keep the Drab&#8217;s stern flag-pole in
sight. We won&#8217;t lose her if there&#8217;s any way of
stopping it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The advance guard of the fog was in upon
them by the time that Joe went once more to
his sending table in the forward end of the
cabin. The light mist extended to the shore,
though it did not altogether screen it. But
the lookout on the Drab&#8217;s deck appeared
wholly watchful at the weather side of the
craft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in touch with any other wireless boat
yet,&#8221; reported Dawson, coming on deck, presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at that heavier white curtain rolling
in,&#8221; uttered Powell Seaton, in a tone near to
anguish.</p>
<p>Whoever was in the drab boat&#8217;s pilot house
took occasion to toot derisively twice on the
auto whistle.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s as much as warning us that their turn
is coming,&#8221; declared Mr. Seaton, wrathfully.</p>
<p>Their faces were wet, now, with the fog as it
rolled in. Slowly the nearby shore faded,
wrapped in the mist.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better get up anchor,&#8221; decided Skipper
Tom. &#8220;Come along, Hank, and you, Hepton.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the anchor came up and was stowed, Captain
Halstead moved the deck speed control
ever so little. The &#8220;Restless&#8221; began to barely
move through the water. They overhauled the
seventy-footer, passing within a hundred feet of
her starboard rail. Yet only the same deck
watch appeared in sight. He favored those on
the bridge deck of the &#8220;Restless&#8221; with a tantalizing
grin.</p>
<p>Halstead slowly circled the drab seventy-footer,
Mr. Seaton keeping ever a watchful eye
on the stranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;There! They&#8217;re hoisting anchor!&#8221; muttered
the charter-man, at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw &#8217;em start,&#8221; nodded the young skipper.
&#8220;And the fog is growing thicker every
minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you going to beat them, if they try
hard to get away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; confessed Halstead, honestly.
&#8220;We may keep &#8217;em in trail, but the
chances are all in favor of the drab boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently the seventy-footer slipped slowly
away from her anchorage. Halstead promptly
closed in, keeping not more than a hundred feet
behind her drab stern. If the fog grew no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
heavier, and the enemy&#8217;s speed no greater, he
could maintain his position.</p>
<p>But the sea-born fog continued to come, looking
as though it arrived in ever-increasing billows.</p>
<p>Once the seventy-footer&#8217;s stern vanished for
a moment or two. Tom, cautiously increasing
the speed, soon came in sight of that drab stern
once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to croak, sir,&#8221; warned the
young motor boat skipper, &#8220;but, luck aside, it
looks as though we&#8217;re about done for in this
salt water blindman&#8217;s buff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I realize it,&#8221; nodded Powell Seaton.</p>
<p>Just then the seventy-footer crawled ahead
again into the fog, and was lost to the pursuer.
Throwing the wheel somewhat to port, Captain
Halstead tried to come up on the Drab&#8217;s quarter.
A full minute&#8217;s anxious suspense followed, but
the enemy&#8217;s stern did not show through the
white shroud of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Then Halstead threw off the power without
applying the reverse. The &#8220;Restless&#8221; drifted
under what was left of her headway.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve done it,&#8221; uttered Tom Halstead,
grimly. &#8220;They&#8217;ve given us the slip&mdash;gotten
away in this white mass of mystery!&#8221;</p>
<p>Shaking, Powell Seaton leaned against the
deck-house, his face pallid with sheer misery.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>A GLEAM OF HOPE THROUGH THE SHROUD OF FOG</h3>
</div>
<p>Resting one hand lightly on the top
spokes of the wheel, young Halstead
turned to his employer with a look of
keenest sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any order you wish to give now,
Mr. Seaton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What order can I give,&#8221; demanded the
charter-man, with a piteous smile, &#8220;unless it be
to say, &#8216;find the drab boat&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom made a grimace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I know how senseless that order
would be,&#8221; pursued Seaton, with a nervous
twitching of his lips. In fact, at this moment
it filled one with pity, just to witness the too-plain
signs of his inward torment and misery.</p>
<p>There was a pause, broken, after a few moments,
by the charter-man saying, as he made
a palpable effort to pull himself together:</p>
<p>&#8220;Halstead, you&#8217;ve shown so much sense all
along that I leave it to you to do whatever you
deem best.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skipper Tom&#8217;s brow cleared at once. A look
of purpose flashed into his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll keep eastward out to sea, sir, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
a little bit to the northeast, until we get out in
the usual path of the southbound steamers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And after that?&#8221; demanded Powell Seaton,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;All we can do, sir, then, will be to wait until
we get a wireless communication with other
vessels.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead, lad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom moved the speed control slowly, until
the &#8220;Restless&#8221; went loafing along at a speed of
six miles an hour. Heading weatherward, he
gave more heed to the wheel, for there were
signs that the water was going to roughen somewhat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hank!&#8221; called the young skipper, and Butts
came to the bridge deck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sound the fog-whistle every minute,&#8221; directed
Halstead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too-whoo-oo-oo!&#8221; sounded the melancholy,
penetrating note through the mist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to keep that up, Captain
Halstead?&#8221; inquired Mr. Seaton, in instant apprehension.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got to, sir. It&#8217;s the law of the ocean in a
deep fog.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it signals our location to the enemy on
the drab boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it keeps the seventy-footer within sound
of our horn all the time,&#8221; laughed Halstead,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
&#8220;so much the better. Then the Drab will be
within range of our marine glasses when the
fog lifts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It shows those rascals the direction of our
course, too,&#8221; cried Seaton, in a still troubled
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to observe the law, sir, even if
<i>they</i> do break it,&#8221; Tom gently urged. &#8220;That
other boat&#8217;s people have been acting like pirates
all along, but that would be no excuse for us.
What if we cut into a lumber-laden schooner,
and sank her at once?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Seaton was obliged to nod his assent.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fearfully tough piece of luck for us,
this fog,&#8221; Tom continued, feelingly, &#8220;but we&#8217;ve
got to make the most of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And, if Anson Dalton gets aboard any
Brazil-bound steamer while we&#8217;re in this fog,
the whole great game for myself and my friends
is lost,&#8221; faltered Seaton.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that steamer has a wireless installation,&#8221;
retorted the young motor boat skipper, &#8220;then
we&#8217;ve every chance in the world to reach her
before the Drab possibly can. Joe will hear
her wireless two hours or more before the other
fellows can hear or locate a fog-horn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s a dreadful uncertainty that this
fog puts upon us,&#8221; groaned the unhappy
charter-man. &#8220;Dalton may take advantage of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
this white shroud to run straight for the nearest
post office and mail the papers that he stole.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Tom&#8217;s mildly warning look checked
Mr. Seaton ere he had time to say more in the
hearing of Hepton.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll come aft, sir, we&#8217;ll talk this over,&#8221;
suggested Halstead, in a low voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gladly,&#8221; murmured the charter-man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, then, sir,&#8221; almost whispered the motor
boat skipper, as he and his employer stood on
the deck aft, &#8220;you&#8217;ve written out a duplicate of
the papers that were stolen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have the duplicate set in an inside pocket,&#8221;
responded Seaton, tapping his coat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you ready to chance the mailing of
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s a fearful risk, a terrible one, even
to think of sending such priceless papers by
registered mail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At least, sir,&#8221; urged Tom, &#8220;you would be
sure the documents were properly started on
their way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet with no surety that they wouldn&#8217;t fall
into wrong hands at the other end,&#8221; shuddered
Seaton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, since your life would undoubtedly be
the forfeit if you attempted to take the papers
yourself, will you trust me, or Joe, to board the
first steamer we pick up by wireless?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wh&mdash;what do you advise, Halstead?&#8221;
queried Seaton, with the air and tone of a man
tortured by uncertainty and hesitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I advise, sir, your making a very definite
move of one kind or another, without the loss
of another hour,&#8221; rejoined young Halstead, almost
sharply. &#8220;Simply drifting in a fog won&#8217;t
settle anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know that only too well,&#8221; replied
Powell Seaton, desperately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us,&#8221; proposed Skipper Tom, &#8220;take a
northerly course. We&#8217;ll try to pick up a Rio-bound
steamship. Failing in that, let us put in
for land, you to send the papers off by registered
mail&mdash;or I&#8217;ll take train for New York and
go by the first boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; agreed Powell Seaton, falteringly.
&#8220;Halstead, my boy, I&#8217;ve pondered and
worried over this until my brain almost refuses
to act. I&#8217;m glad to have your clearer brain to
steady me&mdash;to guide me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are your papers sealed?&#8221; asked Captain
Tom, after a little further thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but I can soon attend to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d go below and do it, then, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you; I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Powell Seaton, as he started down the after
companionway, trembled so that compassionate
Halstead aided him. Then, returning, the Motor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
Boat Club boy stepped steadily forward to the
bridge deck.</p>
<p>Studying the time, Tom determined to keep
to the present course for fifteen minutes more,
and at the same speed, then to head about
due north. This, he figured, would keep him
about in the path of southmoving coast steamships.</p>
<p>Hank, who was still at the wheel, took the
orders. Joe, after a glance at the bridge deck
chronometer, dropped below on his way to his
sending table. The crash of his call soon
sounded at the spark-gap and quivered on its
lightning way up the aerials.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing happening in my line,&#8221; announced
Dawson, soberly, when, some minutes later, he
returned to deck.</p>
<p>Captain Tom stood by, almost idly attending
to the fog-horn, though Butts would have been
able to do that as well as steer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you get anything at all?&#8221; Halstead inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing; not a click by way of answer,&#8221;
Joe Dawson responded. &#8220;I had half a hope
that I might be able to pick up a ship that could
relay back to another, and so on to New York.
If that had happened, I was going to ask the
companies direct, in New York, when their next
boats would leave port. I&#8217;ll do that, if I get a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
chance. I&#8217;m bound to know when to look for
the next Rio boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If this fog seems likely to last,&#8221; resumed
Halstead, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking about increasing
to ten miles and keeping right on toward New
York.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully!&#8221; enthused Dawson. &#8220;Fine!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; so I thought at first, but I have changed
my mind. If we get wholly out of these waters
we might put a messenger aboard a steamship
bound for Rio Janeiro, and then Dalton, by
hanging about in these waters, might find a
chance to board. If he suspected our messenger&mdash;and
it may be you or I&mdash;it might be the same
old Clodis incident all over again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe&#8217;s face lengthened.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s growing wearing, to hang about here all
the time,&#8221; he complained. &#8220;I&#8217;m near to having
operator&#8217;s cramp, as it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare!&#8221; Skipper Tom warned him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I won&#8217;t,&#8221; agreed Dawson.</p>
<p>For four hours more the &#8220;Restless&#8221; continued
nearly due north, at the same original
speed of six miles an hour. Halstead began to
think of putting back, slowly retracing his
course. Joe went down for his regular hourly
&#8220;sit&#8221; at the sending table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; yelled Dawson, emerging from
the motor room several minutes later.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>He was waving a paper and appeared highly
excited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Picked up anything?&#8221; called Tom Halstead,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sirree!&#8221; uttered Joe, delightedly,
thrusting a paper into his chum&#8217;s hand. &#8220;The
Jepson freight liner, &#8216;Glide,&#8217; is making an
extra trip out of schedule. Here&#8217;s her position,
course and gait. We ought to be up to her
within two and a half hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom himself took the news to Powell Seaton.
That gentleman, on hearing the word, leaped
from the lower berth in the port stateroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glorious!&#8221; he cried, his eyes gleaming
feverishly as he hustled into an overcoat.</p>
<p>Then he whispered, in a lower voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Halstead, you&#8217;re&mdash;you&#8217;re&mdash;It!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; demanded the young motor boat skipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll take the papers on to Rio!&#8221;</p>
<p>A gleam lit up Halstead&#8217;s eyes. Yet, in another
instant he felt a sense of downright regret.
He was not afraid of any dangers that the trip
might involve, but he hated the thought of being
weeks away from this staunch, trim little craft
of which he was captain and half-owner.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, sir,&#8221; he replied, though without
enthusiasm. &#8220;I&#8217;ll undertake it&mdash;I&#8217;ll go to Rio
for you.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>WHEN THE MOTOR BOAT CLUB BOYS &#8220;WENT DAFFY&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>All this had been spoken in whispers.
Both Mr. Seaton and Tom Halstead
were keenly aware of the presence of the
prisoner in the starboard stateroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem as overjoyed as I thought
you might be,&#8221; observed Powell Seaton, in a
tone of disappointment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going through for you, sir, and I&#8217;ll deliver
the papers into the proper hands, if I live,&#8221;
replied Tom Halstead.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re not afraid of the big chances of
danger that you may be running?&#8221; persisted
his employer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I believe every human being has times
when he&#8217;s afraid,&#8221; Skipper Tom replied, honestly.
&#8220;But I shan&#8217;t be any more afraid than
you&#8217;ve seen me once or twice since this cruise
began.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll bet on your success,&#8221; rejoined Mr.
Seaton, holding out his hand, which the young
motor boat captain grasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose we go on deck where we can talk
a little more safely, sir,&#8221; whispered Tom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>They made their way above and forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any further word, Dawson?&#8221; inquired the
charter-man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t signaled since I brought up that
last message,&#8221; Joe replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course not,&#8221; retorted Powell Seaton.
&#8220;It was an idiotic question for me to ask, but
I&#8217;m so excited, boys, that I don&#8217;t pretend to
know altogether what I&#8217;m talking about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Halstead bent forward to look at the
compass. He found Hank Butts steering as
straight as the needle itself pointed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth can I do to pass the time of
waiting?&#8221; wondered Mr. Seaton, feverishly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eat,&#8221; laughed Tom. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t had a
meal since I don&#8217;t know when. Give me the
wheel, Hank, and see what you can fix up for
Mr. Seaton in the way of food.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet, poking along at that slow rate of speed,
cutting through the fog but not able to see a
boat&#8217;s length ahead, proved an ordeal that tested
the patience of all.</p>
<p>After awhile Joe returned to the sending
table, in order to get in touch with the &#8220;Glide&#8221;
and make sure that the two vessels were still
approaching each other head-on.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wonderful&mdash;wonderful, this wireless
telegraph that keeps all the great ships and
many of the small ones in constant communication,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
declared Powell Seaton, coming up
on deck after having finished his meal.
&#8220;Yet it seems odd, doesn&#8217;t it, to think of
even freight boats carrying a wireless installation?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not when you stop to consider the value of
the freight steamships, and the value of their
cargoes,&#8221; rejoined Tom Halstead. &#8220;If a ship
at sea gets into any trouble, where in older
times she would have been lost, now all she
has to do is to signal to other vessels within
two or three hundred miles, and relief is sent on
its way to the ship that needs it. In the case
of a freight steamer the wireless aboard means
greater safety for the crew and often saves the
owners the cost of ship and cargo. The Standard
Oil people were among the first to think of
the wireless for cargo-carrying boats. They installed
the wireless on their tank steamers, and
it wasn&#8217;t long before the owners of other freight
vessels realized the value of such an installation.
Now, every freight boat that amounts to
much has the wireless aboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You speak of the wireless being used at a
distance of two or three hundred miles,&#8221; pursued
the charter-man. &#8220;Dawson can&#8217;t send the
electric wave that far, can he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; because our signal mast is shorter
than that on a big steamship. The length of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
our aerials is less. Still, we can handle a message
for a pretty good distance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What distance, Halstead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, our ideal distance is about sixty miles;
we can make it seventy easily, and, under the
best conditions, we can drive a message, so that
it can be understood, for about ninety miles.
But that doesn&#8217;t really hold us down to even
ninety miles. If there&#8217;s a wireless ship within
our radius we can ask her to relay for us. With
a few ships spread out at proper intervals we
could easily wire direct from the &#8216;Restless&#8217; to
the coast of England.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe,&#8221; called Tom to his chum as the latter
came on deck between wireless performances,
&#8220;do you notice that the fog is lightening off to
weatherward?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; the fog is heaviest off to westward,
and we&#8217;ve been working out of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By the time we reach the &#8216;Glide&#8217; I believe
we&#8217;re going to have some open weather around
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be fine if we do,&#8221; nodded young Dawson.
&#8220;It&#8217;s nasty work going up alongside of a
big ship when you can&#8217;t see fifty feet away.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they watched and waited, while the &#8220;Restless&#8221;
stole slowly along, the fog about them became
steadily lighter, though off to the westward
it remained a thick, dense bank.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say, it&#8217;d be great to have four or five miles
of clear sea around us, so that we could see
whether the seventy-foot boat has kept to anything
like our course,&#8221; declared Hank.</p>
<p>At last the &#8220;Restless&#8221; came to within twenty
minutes&#8217; hailing distance of the &#8220;Glide,&#8221; as the
young motor boat skipper figured it. Then, a
few minutes later, a deep-toned fog-horn came
to them faintly. As the minutes passed, now,
this blast became heavier and nearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only a few minutes left with you, Joe,
old chum,&#8221; declared Captain Tom, with a half-sigh.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll take great, good care of the dear
old craft, I know, while I&#8217;m gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as Mr. Seaton is done with the boat
I&#8217;ll tie her up until you get back&mdash;that&#8217;s what
I&#8217;ll do,&#8221; grunted Dawson. &#8220;No sailing without
a skipper for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t look so bad about it, Cap,&#8221;
grinned Hepton. &#8220;I wish it was me, cut out
for a long trip to Rio and back. Maybe I
wouldn&#8217;t jump at such a chance. Some folks
are born lucky!&#8221;</p>
<p>Too-woo-oo!</p>
<p>The oncoming steamship&#8217;s deep fog-horn
sounded loud and sullen, now. Tom Halstead,
still at the wheel, was peering constantly forward
for the first glimpse of the freighter, for
the fog had lightened much by this time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There she is!&#8221; hailed keen-eyed Joe, on the
lookout for this sight. &#8220;You can just make out
her bow poking up through the fog. She must
be a thousand feet off yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>With two boats approaching each other, this
distance was, of course, quickly covered. Finding
that he could see the other craft at such a
distance, Skipper Tom threw on a little more
speed, making a wide turn and so coming up
alongside on a parallel course.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take the wheel, Hank,&#8221; directed the young
skipper, seizing the megaphone and stepping to
the port rail.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Glide,&#8217; ahoy!&#8221; bawled Halstead through
the megaphone.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Restless,&#8217; ahoy!&#8221; came back from the
freighter&#8217;s bridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lie to and let us come alongside, won&#8217;t you?
We want to put a passenger aboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Passenger? Where for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rio, of course. That&#8217;s where you&#8217;re bound,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to be mighty quick about it,&#8221;
came the emphatic answer. &#8220;We can&#8217;t afford
stops on our way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We may want to delay you a few minutes,&#8221;
began Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Few minutes, nothing!&#8221; came the gruff retort.
&#8220;We can&#8217;t be held up in that fashion.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We can pay for all the trouble we put
you to,&#8221; retorted Halstead. Powell Seaton
produced and waved a bulky wad of banknotes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if you want to pay extra, above the fare,
it&#8217;ll be a little different,&#8221; came, in mollified
tones, from the bridge. The captain of the
&#8220;Glide&#8221; was now much more accommodating.
The fare received from a passenger put aboard
in mid-sea would go to the owners of the
freighter. But any extra money, paid for
&#8220;trouble,&#8221; would be so much in the pocket of
the &#8220;Glide&#8217;s&#8221; sailing-master.</p>
<p>Several new faces appeared at the rail of the
freighter, as that big craft slowed down and
one of her mates superintended the work of
lowering the side gangway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo, lobster-smack!&#8221; roared one derisive
voice above the freighter&#8217;s rail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; called another voice, jeeringly, &#8220;it
may be all right to go lobster-fishing, but it&#8217;s no
sort of good business to leave one of your catch
of lobsters in command of even a smack like
that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Halstead reddened angrily. One of his
fists clenched unconsciously as he shot a wrathful
look upward at the rail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you mentally-dented pilot of a fourth-rate
peanut roaster of a boat, do you go by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
craft you know without ever giving a hail?&#8221;
demanded a mocking voice, that of the first derisive
speaker.</p>
<p>Standing at the rail of the &#8220;Restless,&#8221; Tom
Halstead almost dropped the megaphone overboard
from the sheer stagger of joy that caught
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, you Ab! You worthless Ab Perkins!&#8221;
roared the young motor boat skipper, in huge
delight. &#8220;And you, Dick Davis!&#8221;</p>
<p>The two who stood at the &#8220;Glide&#8217;s&#8221; rail
overhead, and who had called down so mockingly,
stood in uniform caps and coats identical
with those worn by Halstead and his mates
aboard the motor boat. They wore them with
right, too, for Perkins and Davis were two of
the most famous of the many youngsters who
now composed the Motor Boat Club of the
Kennebec.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey! What&#8217;s this?&#8221; roared the usually
quiet Joe Dawson, his face wreathed in smiles.
He almost danced a jig.</p>
<p>Hank Butts had never before seen either
Davis or Perkins, but he knew about them, all
right. He knew that uniform, too, the same that
he wore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, then&mdash;altogether!&#8221; yelled Hank.
&#8220;Give it with a roar, boys!&#8221;</p>
<p>Powell Seaton stared in bewildered amazement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
So did officers, crew and others at the
&#8220;Glide&#8217;s&#8221; rail and on her bridge.</p>
<p>For five lusty young Americans, all wearing
the same uniform, all bronzed deeply with the
tan that comes of the gale and the sun, all keen-eyed,
quick and sure as tars ever are, roared in
mighty chorus:</p>
<p>&#8220;M-B-C-K! M-B-C-K! Motor Boat Club!
WOW!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE FIRST KINK OF THE PROBLEM SOLVED</h3>
</div>
<p>Again the roaring chorus rang out.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this? College boys&#8217; joke on
me, or a floating mad-house?&#8221; huskily
roared down the freighter&#8217;s captain from the
bridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, captain,&#8221; sang back Tom Halstead.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll make it plain to you as soon as
we get a chance. We&#8217;re neither as bad nor as
dangerous as we seem.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Glide&#8217;s&#8221; headway had all but ceased
by this time, and the side gangway was at last
in place. The &#8220;Restless&#8221; was run in close,
while Hank stood up on the top of the forward
deck-house with a coil of line, waiting until it
came time to leap across onto the platform of
the freighter&#8217;s gangway and make the line fast.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>As quickly as the line was secured Captain
Tom Halstead followed Butts, and dashed on
past him up the steps of the gangway. Ab and
Dick came down to meet him, each grabbing one
of the young skipper&#8217;s hands and wringing it.</p>
<p>Then they turned to give the same greeting
to Joe Dawson, who gasped:</p>
<p>&#8220;Gracious, but it <i>does</i> seem good to meet fellows
of the Club and from the old home town
at that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Seaton, though following in more leisurely
fashion, now passed them, going on up
to the deck. There he met Captain Rawley.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind what my young men do, captain,&#8221;
begged the charter-man, &#8220;and don&#8217;t
mind if they delay you for a few minutes. I&#8217;ll
make good the damage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Help yourself to a little of my time, then,
sir,&#8221; grimaced the freighter&#8217;s captain. &#8220;Anything
that I can spare from the proper time of
the run, you understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How on earth do you fellows happen to be
on this ship, of all places in the world?&#8221; demanded
Tom Halstead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy enough to explain,&#8221; laughed Dick
Davis. &#8220;Port authorities at Rio were good
enough to order six motor boats for harbor purposes.
My dad got the chance of building the
boats at his yard at Bath. The Rio motor boats
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
are on board, down in the hold, and Ab and I
are sent along to deliver the motor boats, put
them in running order at Rio, and, if necessary,
teach the natives how to run such craft.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you fellows know we were signaling
you by wireless?&#8221; Joe was asking Ab Perkins.
&#8220;Did you know that you were going to see us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t know a blessed thing about it,&#8221; admitted
Ab Perkins, almost sheepishly. &#8220;Dick
and I were asleep in our stateroom. We were
getting ready to come out on deck when we
felt the old tub slackening speed. Then we
came out to see what was happening. We
looked over the rail, and&mdash;<i>wow</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ab again seized Joe Dawson&#8217;s hand, giving it
another mighty shake. Then the irrepressible
Ab reached out for Tom&#8217;s hand, but Dick Davis
was drawing Halstead up on deck.</p>
<p>Readers of the first volume of this series will
remember both Ab and Dick well. They, too,
were boys born near the Kennebec River, and
took part in the stirring adventures narrated in
<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>The Motor Boat Club of The Kennebec</span>, just
before Tom and Joe left for the next scenes of
their activities, as related in <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>The Motor Boat
Club at Nantucket</span> and <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>The Motor Boat Club
off Long Island</span>. Ab Perkins and Dick Davis
were two of the most valued of the early members
of the Club.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>All in a twinkling, Tom Halstead was seized
by an idea. He looked about for Powell Seaton,
saw that gentleman talking with Captain Rawley,
and caught the charter-man&#8217;s eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Mr. Seaton,&#8221; whispered Halstead,
as soon as he had gotten his employer aside,
&#8220;there&#8217;s no great need for me to go to Rio.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not. Give the papers to Dick
Davis, with exact instructions as to who is to
receive them at Rio Janeiro, and those papers
will get into exactly the hands for which you
intend them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You feel certain of that, Halstead?&#8221; demanded
Powell Seaton, his voice tremulous with
anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely sure, sir. Dick Davis can be
trusted as long the world holds together. There
isn&#8217;t the faintest yellow streak in him, either.
Square, straight, keen, brave&mdash;that&#8217;s Dick
Davis. And Ab Perkins would go through the
jaws of anything with Davis! Why, Mr. Seaton,
they&#8217;re Motor Boat Club boys! You can
trust them to the same degree as you&#8217;re willing
to trust me. Moreover, they&#8217;re going down to
Rio on a mission to the Government. They&#8217;ve
got a better chance to get ashore, unmolested
and unwatched, than any other stranger would
have.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Get your friends together, then, somewhere
where we can have a private corner,&#8221; begged
Powell Seaton. &#8220;We&#8217;ll talk this matter over&mdash;we&#8217;ve
got to talk like lightning, at that.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Mr. Seaton sought Captain Rawley,
Tom shot back along the deck to where Joe,
Hank and the two Rio-bound members of the
Motor Boat Club stood talking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hank,&#8221; said Tom, in a low voice, &#8220;Hepton
is all alone down on the &#8216;Restless,&#8217; except for
our prisoner aft. Hepton may be all right, and
I think he is&mdash;but one of our own crowd ought
to be on board our boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be the one, then,&#8221; half-sighed Hank
Butts, turning to descend the side gangway.</p>
<p>Captain Rawley promptly agreed to turn his
own cabin over to the friends who wanted a
private chat.</p>
<p>&#8220;But only for five minutes, mind you,&#8221; he
insisted. &#8220;Then I must be on my way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Behind the closed door of the captain&#8217;s room
Powell Seaton and Tom Halstead swiftly explained
what was wanted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will we do it?&#8221; said Dick Davis, repeating
the question that had been asked him. &#8220;Why,
of course we will. There&#8217;s only one answer
possible. Tom Halstead is fleet captain of the
Motor Boat Club, and a request from Captain
Tom is the same thing as an order.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You will go straight to the American consulate
at Rio Janeiro, then,&#8221; directed Mr. Seaton.
&#8220;From the consulate you will send a messenger
to bring to you Shipley D. Jarvis, whose
address is the American Club. The American
consul will be able to assure you that it is Shipley
D. Jarvis who comes to you. You will turn
over these papers to Mr. Jarvis in the presence
of the American consul. A letter from me is
in the envelope with the papers. That is all,
except&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>After a brief pause Mr. Seaton went on to
caution Dick Davis and Ab Perkins as to the
dangers against which they must guard on the
way. This Tom Halstead supplemented with an
exact description of Anson Dalton and of Captain
Dave Lemly, of the now seized &#8220;Black
Betty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Either, or both, of the rascals may board
this ship a little further along,&#8221; cautioned Mr.
Seaton. &#8220;Night and day you must be on your
guard against them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Tom Halstead quickly outlined to Davis
a system of apparently common-place wireless
messages by means of which Davis might be
able to keep Mr. Seaton informed of the state
of affairs, for some days to come, on board the
&#8220;Glide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some further last instructions were added.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
Powell Seaton wound up by forcing a few banknotes
into the hands of both these unexpected
messengers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait until we&#8217;ve succeeded,&#8221; proposed Dick
Davis.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is for expense money, for sending
wireless messages, and other things,&#8221; replied
Mr. Seaton. &#8220;Your real reward will come later
on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we&#8217;ve succeeded,&#8221; nodded Davis.</p>
<p>So much time had been taken up by this talk
that now all had to step out on deck.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re ready to go aboard our boat, sir,&#8221;
Skipper Tom reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;You and Dawson go, Halstead,&#8221; nodded Mr.
Seaton. &#8220;I want not more than sixty seconds
with Captain Rawley in his own room.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the charter-man of the &#8220;Restless&#8221; came
out once more the thick pile of banknotes in his
pocket had grown a good deal thinner, but Captain
Rawley had been enlisted as a friend to
the cause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, old chums,&#8221; cried Dick Davis,
gripping a hand of Tom and Joe with each of
his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye! Good luck now, and all the way
through life!&#8221; murmured Tom, earnestly, and
with a hidden meaning that Davis caught.</p>
<p>As speedily as Tom and Joe had assisted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
Powell Seaton aboard the motor boat, Hank
cast off, while the crew of the &#8220;Glide&#8221; began
to raise the side gangway.</p>
<p>There were more rousing farewells between
the two groups of Motor Boat Club boys. Then
the hoarse whistle of the &#8220;Glide&#8221; sounded, and
the freighter began to go ahead at half-speed.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Restless&#8221; fell away and astern, yet she
followed the freighter. That she should do so
had been understood with Captain Rawley, and
with Dick and Ab. Powell Seaton intended to
keep the &#8220;Glide&#8221; within sight for at least thirty-six
hours, if possible, in order to make sure that
the seventy-foot drab boat did not attempt to
put Anson Dalton or any other messenger on
board.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we stick to the sea for a hundred years,
Joe,&#8221; laughed Skipper Tom, as he followed the
bigger craft at a distance of eight hundred feet,
&#8220;nothing as lucky as this is likely to happen
again. I was afraid I was booked for Rio,
for sure, and it made me heartsick to think of
leaving the &#8216;Restless&#8217; so long and living
aboard a big tub of an ordinary, steam-propelled
ship!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve taken the step, now, and can&#8217;t very
well change it,&#8221; declared Mr. Seaton, who
looked both pale and thoughtful. &#8220;Halstead,
all I can hope and pray for is that your comrades
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
on the ship ahead are as clever and watchful,
as brave and honest as you think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If wondering about Dick and Ab is all that
ever worries me,&#8221; laughed Tom Halstead,
easily, &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I shall ever have any
wrinkles. I know those boys, Mr. Seaton. We
were born and raised in the same little Maine
seacoast town, and I&#8217;d trust that pair with the errand
if it were my own diamond field at stake.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fog had lifted sufficiently, by this time,
so that clear vision was to be had for at least
a quarter of a mile.</p>
<p>Skipper Tom whistled as he handled the
wheel. Joe Dawson was so relieved in mind
that, after a careful look at the motors, he
threw himself upon one of the berths opposite
and dozed. Hank put in his time looking after
preparations for supper.</p>
<p>&#8220;What ails you, Halstead?&#8221; demanded Seaton,
pausing abruptly beside the young skipper.</p>
<p>For the boy had turned, suddenly, to a sickly
pallor.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has just struck me, sir,&#8221; confessed the
young motor boat skipper, &#8220;that, if Dalton has
the slightest suspicion of what we&#8217;ve done to
outwit him, he&#8217;s just the man who will be desperate
enough to put his whole set of papers
in at the nearest cable office for direct sending
to Rio Janeiro!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>HELPLESS IN THE NORTHEASTER!</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already thought of that,&#8221; nodded
Powell Seaton.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it doesn&#8217;t worry you, sir&mdash;doesn&#8217;t
make you anxious?&#8221; questioned Captain
Tom Halstead.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Of course, Dalton might cable the full
contents of the papers. If the paper could fall
only into Governor Terrero&#8217;s hands it would
be well worth the cable tolls. But if such a
cablegram were sent, openly, to Terrero, or one
of his representatives, it would have to go, first
of all, through the hands of the Government
officials who have charge of the cable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But couldn&#8217;t Terrero fix that?&#8221; asked Halstead.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; Rio is out of his state, and beyond the
sphere of his strongest influence. Now, if I
were to land in Rio Janeiro, I would be arrested
on a warrant issued by Terrero&#8217;s judges,
up in the state of Vahia, and I would have to
go to Vahia for trial. Undoubtedly Terrero&#8217;s
rascally officers would shoot me on the way, and
report that I had tried to escape.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what harm could it do to Terrero&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
chances for Dalton to send him the cablegram
direct?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, either the cable officials in Rio are
very great rascals, or else they are honest officials.
If they are rascals, they might hold the
cablegram long enough to act for themselves
on the information it contained. On the other
hand, if they are honest officials, then they would
undoubtedly notify the Government of such a
stupendous piece of news. The Government
would then very likely take charge of my diamond
field itself, which would be wholly legal,
for the Government already owns many, if not
the greater number, of the producing diamond
fields of that country. So, if the Government,
acting on information from its cable officials,
took possession of the news and of the diamond
field, what good would the cablegram do Governor
Terrero? No; you may be very sure
that Dalton won&#8217;t send the contents of the
papers by cablegram. He undoubtedly has the
strongest orders from Terrero against doing
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel better, then,&#8221; Tom admitted. &#8220;For
the moment it came over me, like a thunderbolt,
that Dalton might nip all our work in the bud
by sending a cablegram. Still, couldn&#8217;t he send
it by code?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; for only the ordinary codes can go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
through the Brazilian cable offices, and the Government
officers have the keys to all the codes
that are allowed. Rest easy, Halstead; Dalton
won&#8217;t attempt to use the cable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, if he doesn&#8217;t get aboard the &#8216;Glide,&#8217;
we&#8217;ll beat him out to Brazil&mdash;that&#8217;s the surest
thing in the world!&#8221; cried Tom, with as much
enthusiasm as though the great fortune at stake
were his own.</p>
<p>They were still following in the wake of the
&#8220;Glide.&#8221; Once in a while Dick Davis or Ab
Perkins had the operator on the freighter flash
back a wireless message of a friendly, personal
nature. Joe answered all these.</p>
<p>For thirty-six hours this pleasant stern-chase
lasted. By night the helmsman of the
&#8220;Restless&#8221; kept the searchlight enough in
use to make sure that the drab boat did not
appear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dalton and Lemly lost the &#8216;Glide,&#8217; if they
were looking for her, in the fog,&#8221; chuckled
Halstead, in huge satisfaction. &#8220;Any Rio-bound
boat they can catch now is hopelessly to
the rear of the &#8216;Glide,&#8217; I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe, by wiring back, and asking other wireless
vessels to relay, from time to time, had
ascertained that there was no other steam vessel,
bound for Rio, in close pursuit.</p>
<p>Mr. Seaton took his trick at the wheel occasionally.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
So did Hepton. Joe gave most of
his time to the wireless installation, though he
maintained charge of the motors, Hank doing
most of the work there. All had sleep enough
during the cruise south. Joe used some of his
spare time in carrying out his former plan of
connecting the wireless table with the helmsman
by means of a speaking tube.</p>
<p>They were well down the coast of Florida
when even anxious Powell Seaton declared that
there was no need of cruising longer in the wake
of the &#8220;Glide.&#8221; He felt certain that the
freighter had entirely eluded the vigilance of
those on board the drab boat.</p>
<p>By this time the supply of gasoline was nearly
out. Tom had cautioned the charter-man that
so long a run would use up about the last of
their oil. There was, however, a small sail
fitted to the signal mast. Now, when the crew
of the &#8220;Restless&#8221; turned back, the sail was
hoisted and power shut off.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve oil enough to run perhaps three-quarters
of an hour, sir,&#8221; the young skipper
explained. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to use that up in making
port when we get in sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sailing aboard the &#8220;Restless&#8221; proved lazy
work at the outset. With this small sail there
was not wind enough to carry the boat at much
more than two miles per hour on her northwest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
course for the nearest Florida town where gasoline
was likely to be had.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have a jolly long sail of it,&#8221; laughed
Skipper Tom, &#8220;unless the wind should freshen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we don&#8217;t care,&#8221; smiled Mr. Seaton.
&#8220;At least, you won&#8217;t be overworked. And our
minds are easier&mdash;mine especially.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All of us have easier minds,&#8221; Halstead retorted.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you understand, sir, that the
rest of us have taken this whole business to
heart? We couldn&#8217;t be more concerned than we
are to see the affairs of our charter parties
come through all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I believe that,&#8221; nodded Powell Seaton.
&#8220;You boys have been the strongest sort of personal
friends to me in my troubles. You
couldn&#8217;t possibly have made my affairs, and my
dangers, more thoroughly your own troubles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two hours later a wireless message came
back from the &#8220;Glide.&#8221; It was from Dick
Davis, and couched in vague terms, but meant
to inform those aboard the &#8220;Restless&#8221; that the
drab seventy-footer was still out of sight. An
hour after that a second message reached the
motor boat. Soon after the &#8220;Restless&#8221; found
herself unable to answer, though still able to
receive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hank, are you feeling particularly strong
to-day?&#8221; inquired Mr. Seaton.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always strong, sir,&#8221; replied the young
steward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why not rack your pantry stores in
order to supply the biggest thing in a meal for
all hands this evening? I feel more like eating
than I have any day in a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d have to go to a sure-enough number-one
hotel to find a better meal than I&#8217;ll put up
for this evening,&#8221; retorted Hank, grinning gleefully,
as he started for the galley.</p>
<p>In such lazy weather Tom Halstead felt that
he could go below for a nap, especially as Joe
was around. Hepton was left at the wheel.
Tom speedily closed his eyes in one of the
soundest naps he had enjoyed in many a day.
He was awakened by Hank, who came into the
stateroom and shook him by the shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Weather&#8217;s all right, up to now,&#8221; Butts informed
the young captain. &#8220;Still, we don&#8217;t
like the looks of the sky, and the barometer is
beginning to show signs of being eccentric.
Won&#8217;t you come up on deck for a minute, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom was out of his berth in a twinkling.
There was enough of the sea-captain in him for
that. The instant he reached the deck his
gaze swept around anxiously, inquiringly, at
the sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;The clouds up on the northeast horizon don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
look exactly friendly, do they?&#8221; he inquired of
Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Dawson. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t
seen enough of them yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking you will, soon,&#8221; replied Halstead.
&#8220;How&#8217;s the wind been?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From the east, sir,&#8221; replied Hepton, who
was at the wheel.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s working around to northeast, now,&#8221;
muttered Halstead. &#8220;And it was almost from
the south when I turned in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom stood by the barometer, watching it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trouble coming,&#8221; he said, briefly.</p>
<p>Within half an hour his prediction began to
be verified. The darkish, &#8220;muddy&#8221; clouds
first seen on the northeast horizon were looming
up rapidly, the wind now driving steadily
from that quarter. Even with all the smallness
of her single sail the &#8220;Restless&#8221; was heeling
over considerably to port.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lay along here, Hank, and help me to put a
double reef in the sail,&#8221; Tom ordered. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
want this little bit of canvas blown away from
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Tom called, he eased off the sheet, and
Hepton lounged away from the wheel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad,&#8221; muttered Hank Butts. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
been making a good four knots since the wind
freshened.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m out of a guess if there isn&#8217;t a wind
coming that&#8217;d take a sail out of its fastenings
in ten seconds,&#8221; rejoined Halstead, working
industriously with the reeves.</p>
<p>A light squall struck them before the boys
had finished their task.</p>
<p>&#8220;A September northeaster along this coast
is no laughing matter, from all I&#8217;ve heard of
it,&#8221; Tom explained as the two boys took the
last hitches. &#8220;Now, come on, Hank. We&#8217;ll
hoist her.&#8221;</p>
<p>With long rhythmic pulls at the halyards Tom
and Butts got the shortened sail up, making all
secure.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better take the wheel, Joe,&#8221; sang out
the young skipper. &#8220;Hepton, stand by to give
a hand if the helm moves hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem rather excited over a pleasant
breeze like this,&#8221; observed Powell Seaton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; said Tom, quietly. &#8220;I only hope I
am taking too much precaution. I&#8217;ve never
handled a boat along the Florida coast before,
you know, sir, so it&#8217;s best to err on the side
of caution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hank was sent off on the jump, now, to make
everything secure, while Skipper Tom took his
place on the bridge deck at starboard to watch
the weather.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess there&#8217;ll be time, now, Hank, to rig
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
life lines on the bridge deck,&#8221; hinted Halstead,
coolly. &#8220;Never mind about any aft. Whoever
goes below can go through the motor
room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Catching a look full of meaning in the young
commander&#8217;s eye, Butts hustled about his new
task.</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to be making very serious preparations,&#8221;
suggested Powell Seaton, seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing like being a fool on the wise side,&#8221;
answered Skipper Tom, calmly.</p>
<p>Within ten minutes more the wind had freshened
a good deal, and the &#8220;Restless&#8221; was bending
over considerably to port, running well, indeed,
considering her very small spread of
canvas.</p>
<p>Now, the sky became darker. The weather
was like that on shore in autumn when the birds
are seen scurrying to cover just before the
storm breaks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon there&#8217;s going to be something close
to trouble, after all,&#8221; observed Powell Seaton,
when it became necessary for him to hold his
hat on.</p>
<p>Tom nodded in a taciturn way, merely saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to stay on deck, Mr. Seaton,
you&#8217;d better put on a cap, or a sou&#8217;wester.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Seaton started below, through the motor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
room. While he was still there the gale struck,
almost without further warning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Watch the wind and ease off a bit, Joe,&#8221;
bawled Skipper Halstead in his chum&#8217;s ear.</p>
<p>Joe Dawson nodded slightly. The gale was
now upon them with such fury that making
one&#8217;s self heard was something like work.</p>
<p>Despite the prompt easing by the helm, the
&#8220;Restless&#8221; bowled over a good deal as the
crest of the first in-rolling wave hit her.</p>
<p>Powell Seaton, a cap on his head, appeared
at the motor room hatchway. Tom motioned
him to remain where he was.</p>
<p>Clutching at the rail, Tom Halstead kept his
face turned weatherward most of the time. He
knew, now, that a fifty-five-foot boat like the
&#8220;Restless,&#8221; weather-staunch though she was,
was going to have about all she could do in the
sea that would be running in a few minutes
more.</p>
<p>Nor did he make any mistake about that. A
darkness that was almost inky settled down over
them. Bending through the hatchway, the
young sailing master yelled to Powell Seaton
to switch on the running lights.</p>
<p>&#8220;For we&#8217;ll need &#8217;em mighty soon, if we don&#8217;t
now,&#8221; Captain Tom added.</p>
<p>Hank reappeared with rain-coats, and with
his own on. Hardly had those on deck so covered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
themselves when, accompanied by a vivid
flash of lightning and a crashing peal of thunder,
the rain came down upon them. At first there
were a few big drops. Then, the gale increasing,
the rain came in drenching sheets. The
decks began to run water, almost choking the
scuppers.</p>
<p>The heeling of the &#8220;Restless&#8221; was no longer
especially noticeable. She was rolling and
pitching in every direction, accompanied by a
straining and creaking of timbers.</p>
<p>Powell Seaton, standing below, clutching for
support, and not much of a sailor at best, began
to feel decidedly scared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we going to be able to weather this,
Captain Halstead?&#8221; he yelled up, as the young
skipper paused close by the hatchway.</p>
<p>Though the noise of the now furious gale prevented
Tom from making out the words very
clearly, he knew, by instinct, almost, what had
been asked of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Weather the gale, sir?&#8221; Tom bawled down,
hoarsely. &#8220;Of course! We&#8217;ve got to!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a new sound that made the young
sailing master jump, then quiver. With a great
tearing and rending the single canvas gave way
before the roaring gale. In a trice the sail was
blown to fluttering ribbons!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>&#8220;C.Q.D! C.Q.D.!&mdash;HELP!&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Lay along with me, Hank!&#8221; bawled the
young skipper, hoarsely, in the steward&#8217;s
ear. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to cut away
what&#8217;s left of the sail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither helmsman could wisely be spared.
Though the boat now had no power of her own
she was being driven sharply before the gale,
and some fine handling of the wheel was needed
in order to keep the boat so headed that she
might wallow as little as possible in the trough
of the sea.</p>
<p>Nor was the work of the young captain and
Hank Butts anything like play. Making their
way out along the top of the cabin deck-house
was in itself hazardous. They were forced to
clutch at any rigging that came to hand to
avoid being washed overboard, for the waves
were dashing furiously over the helpless boat.</p>
<p>It was not much of a task to haul in the sheet,
making fast. Then, using their sailor&#8217;s knives,
they slashed away.</p>
<p>It was needful for one of them to go aloft.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can do it,&#8221; proposed Hank, summoning
all his courage.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know you can,&#8221; Tom bawled in his ear.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m not going to send anyone where I
wouldn&#8217;t go myself. It&#8217;s mine to go aloft.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thrusting his knife securely into the sheath
at the end of its lanyard, Tom Halstead began
to climb. Hank watched him closely. The pair
at the wheel had no time to observe. All their
attention was needed on their own work.</p>
<p>As he climbed, Tom Halstead had a sensation
of being in danger of being pitched overboard.</p>
<p>Next, as the &#8220;Restless&#8221; lay over harder than
she had yet done, it seemed as though the mast
were bent on touching the water. Halstead had
to halt in his climbing, satisfied to hold on for
dear life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if we only had enough gasoline aboard!&#8221;
groaned the young skipper, regretfully. &#8220;It
would be a tough storm, even then, though
nothing like as bad as this!&#8221;</p>
<p>As the boat partially righted herself, he went
on with his climbing. At length he found himself
where he could bring his knife into play,
slashing away the fragments of the wind-torn
canvas. When the work was done Halstead let
himself to the deck again, half-expecting that
the force of the pitching and fury of the gale
would catch him and sweep him over into the
dark, raging waters.</p>
<p>Yet he reached the deck in safety, finding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
himself beside Hank Butts, who, by this time,
looked more like some water-logged thing than
a natty steward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on below to the sail-locker,&#8221; roared
Captain Tom in the other boy&#8217;s ear. &#8220;Be careful
to hold to the life lines and go slow when
the boat heels over. We&#8217;ll get the new sail out
and rig it&mdash;if we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hepton, seeing them coming, made a sign to
Joe, who stood doggedly braced at the wheel.
Joe did all he could&mdash;it was little enough&mdash;to
swing the boat&#8217;s head a trifle so that she would
ride more easily, if possible, in that terrible sea.</p>
<p>Slowly Tom and Hank made their way to the
motor room door and slipped down below.
There Powell Seaton, his face white, confronted
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain, this is awful. I don&#8217;t see how the
&#8216;Restless&#8217; rides such a sea at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;d not only ride but steer well, sir, if we
had gasoline enough to run her by her propellers,&#8221;
Halstead shouted back. &#8220;I&#8217;d go all the
way to Havana in a gale like this if I could
use the twin propellers. The &#8216;Restless&#8217; is a
sea boat, and she can&#8217;t sink unless the watertight
compartments are smashed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she can turn over and ride keel upward,
can&#8217;t she?&#8221; demanded Mr. Seaton, with a
ghastly grin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She can, sir, if she heels enough,&#8221; Tom admitted.
&#8220;But that&#8217;s why Joe&#8217;s at the wheel&mdash;because
we need a fellow who can make the
most out of such headway as the force of wind
and waves gives us. And now, sir, Hank and
I must try to rig a new sail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Out of the sail-locker they dragged the new
canvas. It was all in readiness for rigging.
In calm weather they could have done this
readily&mdash;but now? Only time could tell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lend &#8217;em a hand, Hepton!&#8221; roared Joe, as
he saw the young captain and helper appear
with the bulky canvas.</p>
<p>It was all the three of them could do, in the
rolling, high seas in which the &#8220;Restless&#8221;
pitched like a chip of wood, to get that sail on
top of the cabin deck-house. Bit by bit they
rigged it in place, working fast, straining muscle
and sinew to hold the sail against the gale
that strove to carry the canvas overboard. At
last, they had it in place, ready for hoisting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand by to hoist,&#8221; sang out Captain Tom.
&#8220;The two of you. Go slow! I&#8217;ll watch for
trouble as you shake it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>All the reefs had been taken in the sail before
hoisting. Tom Halstead had made up his
mind to be satisfied with just a showing of canvas
to catch the high wind&mdash;enough to keep the
boat steady.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>As the sail went up, flapping wildly in the
breeze, Halstead began to have his doubts
whether it would last long. It was their last
chance, however, for the control of the &#8220;Restless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lay along here!&#8221; roared Tom, through his
hands as a trumpet, when he saw that they had
made the halyards fast. Now he signed to
them to help him haul in on the sheet. Joe,
watching, just making out the white of the canvas
through the darkness, threw the wheel over
to make the craft catch the wind. In a few moments
more the gale was tugging against the
small spread of canvas, and the &#8220;Restless&#8221; was
once more under control&mdash;while the sail lasted!</p>
<p>All but exhausted, the trio found their way
forward. For a brief space they tumbled below
into the motor room, though Halstead stood
where he could see Joe Dawson and spring to
his aid when needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hank,&#8221; called Halstead, five minutes later,
&#8220;your trick and mine on deck. We&#8217;ll give Joe
and Hepton a chance to get their wind below.&#8221;</p>
<p>Small as was the spread of canvas, Tom
found, when he took the wheel, that the good
little &#8220;Restless&#8221; was plunging stiffly along on
her course. She was a wonderfully staunch little
boat. The young sailing master bewailed his
luck in having hardly any gasoline on board.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
It should never happen again, he promised himself.</p>
<p>Again? Was there to be any &#8220;again&#8221;? The
motor boat captain was by no means blind to
the fact that the &#8220;Restless&#8221; hadn&#8217;t quite an
even chance of weathering this stiff gale. At
any moment the sail might go by the board in
ribbons, as the first had done. Hank was not
even watching the sail. If it gave way it must.</p>
<p>Joe presently came on deck for his next trick
at the wheel. Hepton was with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking about the prisoner in the
starboard stateroom,&#8221; announced Joe. &#8220;It&#8217;s
inhuman to leave him there, locked in and handcuffed,
in such a gale. He must be enduring
fearful torment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded Tom. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just been thinking
that I must go down and set him free as
soon as I&#8217;m relieved.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go along, then,&#8221; proposed young Dawson.
&#8220;I have the wheel, and Hepton by me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taking Hank Butts with him, Tom Halstead
made his way below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dawson was just speaking to me about our
prisoner,&#8221; began Powell Seaton. &#8220;Dawson
thinks he ought to be turned loose&mdash;at least
while this gale lasts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; nodded Captain Halstead. &#8220;I&#8217;m on
my way to do it now.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Will it be safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t help whether it is, or not,&#8221; Skipper
Tom rejoined. &#8220;It&#8217;s a humane thing to do,
and we&#8217;ll have to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Powell Seaton did not interpose any further
objections. It would have been of little moment
if he had, for, on the high seas, the ship&#8217;s
commander is the sole judge of what is to be
done.</p>
<p>Even below decks, going through the electric-lighted
passage and cabin, Tom and Hank made
their way with not a little difficulty. They
paused, at last, before the starboard stateroom
door, and Tom fitted the key in the lock.</p>
<p>Jasper, the man locked within, faced them
with affrighted gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to the bottom?&#8221; he demanded,
hoarsely, tremulously. His very evident terror
gave the young skipper a new idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you prepared to go to the bottom,
Jasper?&#8221; demanded Halstead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I fit to die, do you mean?&#8221; asked the
man, with a strange, sickly grin. &#8220;No, sir; I&#8217;m
not. At least, not until I&#8217;ve cleared myself by
telling a few truths.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come out into the cabin, man,&#8221; ordered Halstead,
leading him. &#8220;Now, sit down, and I&#8217;ll get
your handcuffs off.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young captain of the &#8220;Restless&#8221; unlocked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
the irons about the fellow&#8217;s wrists.
Jasper stretched his hands, flexing his wrists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I can swim, anyway, though I don&#8217;t
believe it will do much good,&#8221; he declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; it won&#8217;t do much good,&#8221; Halstead assented.
&#8220;We&#8217;re something more than forty
miles off the coast. But what do you want to
say? What&#8217;s on your mind? Be quick, man,
for we must be on deck again in a jiffy. I don&#8217;t
want to lose my boat while I&#8217;m below with a
rascal like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t always been a rascal,&#8221; retorted
Jasper, hanging his head. &#8220;At least, I have
been fairly straight, until the other day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you been doing for Dalton and
Lemly?&#8221; demanded Tom Halstead, fixing his
gaze sternly on the frightened fellow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never anything for Dalton,&#8221; whined Jasper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, for Lemly, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve been snooping about a bit, for two
years or so, getting tips for Dave Lemly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What has Lemly been smuggling in the
&#8216;Black Betty&#8217; all this time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Diamonds,&#8221; admitted Jasper, sullenly.</p>
<p>Tom Halstead felt like giving a great start,
but controlled himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Smuggling diamonds under Anson Dalton&#8217;s
orders, eh?&#8221; insisted the young skipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I reckon so.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How did you come into our matter&mdash;as a
guard and a traitor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was on hand when Mr. Seaton was getting
his guards together,&#8221; replied Jasper. &#8220;So was
Dave Lemly&#8217;s mate. The mate told me to jump
in and get my chance with the guard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What other orders did you have?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was to watch my chance to do anything
nasty that I could,&#8221; confessed the fellow, hanging
his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was why you tried to ruin our
aerials?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You also listened to Mr. Seaton and myself,
the night we were going over to Lonely
Island?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jasper squirmed, his face growing more
ashen.</p>
<p>&#8220;You heard what was said about papers
hidden in a cupboard at the bungalow. Did
you? Answer me, confound you!&#8221;</p>
<p>With an appearance of utter rage Tom
bounded at the fellow, as though about to attack
him. Hank closed in, to be ready in case
the attack turned out to be a genuine one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I stole an envelope full of papers,&#8221;
admitted Jasper.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you do with them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I turned them over to Dave Lemly.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where? On Lonely Island?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; Lemly visited the island twice, at
night, while I was on duty there,&#8221; confessed
the fellow, whining and letting his head fall
lower.</p>
<p>&#8220;What else have you done against us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, except trying to disable your wireless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you telling the whole, full truth?&#8221; demanded
Captain Tom Halstead, surveying the
fellow suspiciously. &#8220;As much of the truth as
you want to lay bare before going to the bottom
in this wild storm?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! Oh, yes, yes!&#8221; insisted Jasper, easily.
&#8220;Now, I&#8217;ve cleared my conscience of its load!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; muttered Tom Halstead, dryly.</p>
<p>At that moment a snapping sound overhead
reached their ears. The &#8220;Restless&#8221; veered
about, then heeled dangerously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our second and last sail has gone!&#8221; cried
the young skipper, starting forward. &#8220;Jasper,
I hope you have told me the whole truth, for
there is no knowing, now, how soon you&#8217;ll start
for the bottom&mdash;how soon we&#8217;ll all go down.
Helpless in this sea, the &#8216;Restless&#8217; may &#8216;turn
turtle.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Nor was Tom speaking in jest, nor in any
effort to scare the recent prisoner into a fuller
confession. Indeed, the motor boat captain was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
paying no further heed to the wretch, but making
his way forward. Jasper started to follow,
Hank bringing up the rear.</p>
<p>As they reached the motor room the pitching
and rolling of the boat were awesome enough.
It seemed incredible that a boat the size of the
&#8220;Restless&#8221; could live even a minute in her now
helpless condition.</p>
<p>Joe still stood at the wheel, white-faced but
calm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what we can do now, Tom,&#8221; he
shouted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing but get down to the wireless, and
do anything you can in the way of picking up
some steamship,&#8221; Halstead answered. &#8220;We
might get a tow, or, at least, another spread of
canvas for a third try to ride out the gale. The
chances aren&#8217;t big for us, but&mdash;well, Joe, we&#8217;re
sailors, and can take our medicine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe smiled grittily as he edged away from
the wheel after his chum had taken it.</p>
<p>&#8220;At least, if we go down, we go down in command
of our own ship!&#8221; he yelled bravely in
Tom&#8217;s ear through the wild racket of the gale.</p>
<p>Then Joe went below. The storage batteries
held electricity enough to operate the few lights
and keep the wireless going at intervals for
some hours yet.</p>
<p>Once, in the minutes that dragged by, Hank
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
Butts thought of the fine spread he had been
instructed to serve all hands that night. But
no one else was thinking of food now. Coffee
would have been more to the purpose, but to
start a galley fire was to take the risk of adding
fire at sea to the already more than sufficient
perils of those aboard the &#8220;Restless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every few minutes Captain Tom Halstead
called down through the speaking tube that
connected him with Joe Dawson at the sending
table. Always Joe&#8217;s calm answer came, the
same:</p>
<p>&#8220;Our wireless spark hasn&#8217;t picked up any
other ship yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, just as frequently, Joe would rest his
hand on the sending key again, and send crashing
off into space the signal:</p>
<p>&#8220;C.Q.D.!&#8221; The three letters that carry always
the same message of despair across the
waves.</p>
<p>&#8220;C.Q.D.!&#8221;&mdash;the wireless signal of distress.
&#8220;Help wanted, or we perish!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>THE SPARK FINDS A FRIEND THROUGH THE GALE</h3>
</div>
<p>The time had dragged on far into the
night. Joe was still at the wireless
sending table, sleepless, patient, brave&mdash;a
sailor born and bred.</p>
<p>Jasper, like many another rascal a superstitious
coward in the face of impending death,
was seeking to appease the sting of his conscience
by doing everything in his power to
make amends in these grave moments. He
stood by, pallid-faced yet collected enough to
obey any order instantly.</p>
<p>Captain Tom remained on deck all the time
now, though Hank often relieved him briefly
at the wheel. Both Hepton and Jasper stood
by to help as deck-hands. Powell Seaton came
up on deck occasionally, though he remained
more in the motor room.</p>
<p>Again and again Joe signaled&mdash;always that
desperately appealing &#8220;C.Q.D.!&#8221; It was all
the signal he needed to send out. Wherever
heard, on land or water, the first operator to
catch it would break in at once with a demand
for further particulars.</p>
<p>Yet Joe&#8217;s soul grew sick within him as time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
passed, and no such break came through the
storm-laden air. For Dawson, as well as had
he stood on deck, knew that this endless, malignant
fury of the gale must sooner or later start
the seams of the staunch little craft. Or else,
struck by a wave bigger than any others,
she would lie so far over on her beam ends
that she must finish the man&oelig;uvre by &#8220;turning
turtle&#8221;&mdash;lying with her keel uppermost,
and the crew penned underneath to drown
in haste.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing to report yet, Joe, old fellow?&#8221;
came down Captain Tom&#8217;s brave though anxious
voice for perhaps the fortieth time.</p>
<p>&#8220;No reply to our signals, Tom,&#8221; went back
the answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think our spark is still strong
enough to carry far?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty of electric &#8216;juice&#8217; left,&#8221; Joe responded.
&#8220;The spark is as strong as ever. Oh,
if we only had as much gasoline!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if we only had!&#8221;</p>
<p>But ten minutes after that last call Joe again
sent forth:</p>
<p>&#8220;C.Q.D.! C.Q.D.!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then down the receivers traveled a click&mdash;not
loud, yet unmistakable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you? Answer!&#8221; came the response,
out of the air from some quarter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>In frantic haste Joe Dawson fell upon his key
once more.</p>
<p style='font-size:0.9em; margin: 0.5em 2em'>
Motor yacht &#8220;Restless!&#8221; Under no power whatever.
Gasoline almost gone&mdash;saving the last for any emergency
chance that comes to us. All canvas blown overboard. Do
you get this?</p>
<p>It seemed to frenzied Joe Dawson as though
many minutes passed, yet the response came
promptly:</p>
<p style='font-size:0.9em; margin: 0.5em 2em'>
Give us your present position, &#8220;Restless,&#8221; as best you
know it!</p>
<p>Joe obeyed with fingers that seemed themselves
to be worked by electricity. The receiver
of the message repeated Joe&#8217;s response, to make
sure that it was correct.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; Joe now broke in to answer.</p>
<p style='font-size:0.9em; margin: 0.5em 2em'>
Havana liner, bound north, and, we believe, within thirty
miles of you. Have you been signaling long?</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems as though I had been signaling for
years,&#8221; sent back Joe, laughing nervously to
himself. The answer came:</p>
<p style='font-size:0.9em; margin: 0.5em 2em'>
We&#8217;d heard you before, then, but there was a little mishap
to our installation. You keep at your table to send and
receive. I&#8217;ll do the same at my end. Keep up your courage
until we reach you. Be ready to burn Coston lights
when we ask you to.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></div>
<p>Then how fast Joe Dawson managed to talk
up through the speaking tube! Tom Halstead,
after first announcing the great news to the
deck with a wild cheer, put Hank at the wheel
and hurried below. Shortly, however, the
young skipper was back on deck, bearing the
wonderful news.</p>
<p>In smooth weather the Havana liner, ordinarily
a fifteen-knot boat, would have reached
them in two hours. Under the weather conditions
of this wild night it was much later when
the two craft were within hailing distance by
signal lights. Hank was now in command of
the deck, Skipper Tom and Powell Seaton being
with Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we try to send you a line for a tow?&#8221;
came the demand from the liner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Halstead. Then, with a grimace
he added:</p>
<p>&#8220;But the salvage charge for such a tow will
call for more than we can raise, Joe, old fellow.
I reckon the &#8216;Restless&#8217; will have to be put up
for sale to pay her own bills.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think I&#8217;d let you boys stand the
towing charges?&#8221; demanded Powell Seaton, indignantly.
&#8220;Whatever charges there are are
mine to pay, and I&#8217;m at least good for the entire
purchase price of a few boats like even this
good little old salt water wizard!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>Tom soon afterwards made his way to the
deck, but Mr. Seaton, weak and almost ill after
the hours of anxiety, threw himself upon a
cushioned seat near the wireless sending table.</p>
<p>As Tom stood on the bridge deck he studied
the liner&#8217;s lights as that larger craft man&oelig;uvred
in to the leeward of the motor craft.</p>
<p>Once she had gained this position at a sufficient
distance to make any collision on this wild
sea unlikely, the liner steamed ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand ready to receive our line!&#8221; came to
Joe in clicks through the watch-case receivers
over either ear. He swiftly transmitted the
order through the speaking tube to Halstead on
the bridge.</p>
<p>Then the liner burned another light. Tom
answered with one held in his own hand. It
was the signal to look for the line, and the answer.</p>
<p>Through the darkness came a sudden, red
flash from the after deck of the liner. The wind
was so heavy that those on the bridge deck of the
&#8220;Restless&#8221; could not be sure that they heard
the report of the gun. But a missile whizzed
over their heads, and to this blessed projectile
trailed a thin line that fell across the top of the
cabin deck.</p>
<p>Tom and Hank made a simultaneous bolt to
get hold of that line. It was young Butts who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
secured it. He passed it on to the young captain,
and, together, they leaped to the bridge-deck
with it. From there they crawled forward
over the raised deck, slipping the line, at
last, between the two raised ends of the towing
bitt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, haul in with a will,&#8221; glowed the
young skipper, as they crept back to the bridge-deck.
A great wave swept over them on their
way back. Tom saw it coming, and braced
himself. Hank was caught by the rush of
waters; he would have been swept overboard,
but Halstead grabbed at one of his ankles, holding
on grimly.</p>
<p>At that moment the late prisoner, Jasper,
saw what was happening. Projecting himself
forward over the raised deck, he, too, caught
hold of Hank Butts, while Powell Seaton held
to Jasper.</p>
<p>It was a sort of human chain by which Hank
was pulled to safety. Tom, throughout the excitement,
held the &#8220;thin line&#8221; in one hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haul in this thin line, quickly,&#8221; shouted
the young commander, who could barely make
himself heard above the tumult of the gale.</p>
<p>As the line was some four hundred feet long,
it used up precious moments to haul it and coil
up the slack. As the last of the &#8220;thin line&#8221;
came into their hands there came with it the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
first of a stouter hawser, the two lines being
knotted securely together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on to me, now! Form a chain again,&#8221;
ordered Skipper Tom. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make the hawser
fast forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>All this while the Havana liner, some four
hundred feet away, was going through a complicated
bit of man&oelig;uvering under the hands
of her officers. Alternately she moved at half-speed-ahead,
at stop, or on the reverse, in order
that, despite the high-rolling waves, she might
not go too far ahead and snap the thin line.
But now young Halstead soon had a stout hitch
about the towing bitt at the bow. A few more
turns, then he signaled to those behind holding
him to help him back to the bridge deck. A
dozen great waves had rolled over him on that
smooth raised deck, but the members of the
human chain hauled him back to safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Signal to our friends that they can apply
full speed ahead, Joe, if they want to,&#8221; directed
the young motor boat captain, briefly, as he
reached the comparative safety of the bridge
deck once more.</p>
<p>Over the noise of the gale the answering blast
from the liner&#8217;s whistle came to them as a far-away
sound. But now the big boat ahead
started on at a ten-knot speed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gracious, but this seems good, once more!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
glowed Tom Halstead, taking over the wheel
as the towing hawser tautened and the &#8220;Restless&#8221;
began to move forward under a headway
that could be controlled and directed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t have stood this racket much
longer, without a tow,&#8221; chattered Joe. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
had moments at the wheel, to-night, when, on
account of our helplessness, I&#8217;ve felt sure we
were going to &#8216;turn turtle.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What ails your jaws, old fellow?&#8221; demanded
Tom, looking curiously at his chum. &#8220;Say,
you&#8217;re shaking to pieces, and I don&#8217;t wonder.
Get below and get dry and warm. Get below
all of you, except one to stand by me. Who
can best remain on deck for a few minutes
more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can,&#8221; proposed Jasper, starting forward
with an odd mixture of sullenness and eagerness
in his tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll trust you&mdash;now,&#8221; nodded Captain Halstead,
after eyeing the man keenly. &#8220;The rest
of you get below. We want a few dry folks
aboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>On board there was clothing in abundance,
enough to enable everyone to make at least a
few changes. Now that the &#8220;Restless&#8221; could
be held to a course, Hank Butts cautiously made
a small fire in the galley stove, and then stood
by to watch the fire. After a while he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
coffee going&mdash;this with a &#8220;cold bite&#8221; of
food.</p>
<p>Hepton came up, bye-and-bye, to take the
wheel. As he was wholly capable, Tom surrendered
the helm to him, then dropped down
below for some of that coffee.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve found out to-night what a wireless
is good for,&#8221; declared Joe. &#8220;But for it, we
wouldn&#8217;t have kept the &#8216;Restless&#8217; afloat and
right side up through the night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Until we got this tow I didn&#8217;t expect ever
to see port again,&#8221; Tom Halstead admitted,
quietly. &#8220;Do you know, the worst thing folks
will have against row-boats in the future will
be the fact that row-boats are too small to
carry a wireless installation!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You feel wholly safe, now, do you, captain?&#8221;
demanded Powell Seaton. &#8220;It rather seems to
me that the gale has been getting heavier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It has,&#8221; Halstead admitted. &#8220;If we were
adrift, now, we probably couldn&#8217;t keep right-side
up for ten minutes. But give the &#8216;Restless&#8217;
real headway, and she&#8217;ll weather any gale
that a liner or a warship will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the towing hawser should part!&#8221; shuddered
Mr. Seaton.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d hope to get another line across, and
made fast, before we &#8216;turned turtle,&#8217;&#8221; replied
Skipper Tom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></p>
<p>No one could venture from below on the
bridge deck without being quickly drenched.
For that reason the wheel-reliefs were short.
Hank, by staying right by his galley fire, was
able to keep heat at which anyone coming down
from the bridge deck could dry himself.</p>
<p>By daylight the gale and sea were lighter.
For one thing, the Havana liner had carried
her tow so far north that they were out of the
worst of it. Half an hour after daylight the
wireless operator aboard the larger craft telegraphed
Joe:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve taken you in four miles off the town
of Mocalee. You can get gasoline there. Do
you want to cast off our line now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; flashed back Joe, after consulting
Captain Halstead. &#8220;And our greatest, heartiest
thanks for your fine work for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was further interchange of courtesies,
then the line was cast off as soon as Joe and
Hank had started the twin motors going on the
little that was left of the gasoline. There was
no way, or need, to settle the liner&#8217;s towing
charges now. These could be collected later,
for the &#8220;Restless&#8221; was a boat registered by the
United States authorities. She could be found
and libeled anywhere if her young owners failed
to settle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hooray! But doesn&#8217;t it feel great to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
moving under one&#8217;s own power again!&#8221; chortled
Captain Tom, as he felt the vibration of the
propellers and swung the steering wheel.</p>
<p>Though the coast had been visible from daylight,
the town of Mocalee was not in sight until
the boat neared the mouth of a river. Up this
stream, half a mile, nestled a quaint little
Florida town, where, as one of the natives afterwards
expressed it to Joe, &#8220;we live on fish in
summer and sick Yankees in winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better get on shore, all hands, and
stretch our legs,&#8221; proposed Powell Seaton, after
Skipper Tom had made the &#8220;Restless&#8221; fast at
the one sizable dock of the town. &#8220;I see a hotel
over yonder. I invite you all to be my guests
at breakfast&mdash;on a floor that won&#8217;t rock!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay aboard, then, to look after the
boat,&#8221; volunteered Hepton. &#8220;And you can
rely on me to keep a mighty sharp eye on that
man, Jasper,&#8221; he added, in Halstead&#8217;s ear.</p>
<p>It was after seven o&#8217;clock in the morning
when the shore party from the &#8220;Restless,&#8221;
after strolling about a little, turned toward the
hotel.</p>
<p>As they passed through a corridor on the way
to the office Tom Halstead glanced at a red
leather bag that was being brought downstairs
by a negro bell-boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see the bag that servant has?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
asked Tom, in a whisper, as he clutched Powell
Seaton&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Scar on the side, and all, I&#8217;d
know that bag anywhere. It&#8217;s the one Anson
Dalton brought over the side when he boarded
the &#8216;Restless&#8217; from the &#8216;Constant&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>TOM HALSTEAD SPRINGS THE CLIMAX</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Can that fellow be here?&#8221; demanded
Powell Seaton, his lips twitching.</p>
<p>&#8220;He must be&mdash;or else he has sent
someone else with his baggage,&#8221; Tom Halstead
answered, in an undertone.</p>
<p>None of the party had paused, but had passed
on into the office.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to know,&#8221; whispered Powell
Seaton, tremulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you go ahead, sir, and register us for
breakfast, and I&#8217;ll attend to finding out about
this new puzzle.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Mr. Seaton went toward the desk, Tom
signed to Hank Butts to follow him aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;About all you can do, Hank, is to get outside,
not far from the door, and see whether
Dalton goes out,&#8221; Halstead declared, after having
briefly explained the situation. &#8220;If Dalton
leaves the hotel, give us word at once.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Here, you take charge of this bag of mine,
then,&#8221; begged Hank, turning so that the clerk
at the desk could not see.</p>
<p>Butts had come ashore in a long rain-coat
drawn on over his other clothing. Now, he
quickly opened a small satchel that he had also
brought with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That old hitching weight of yours!&#8221; cried
Tom, in a gasping undertone, as he saw Hank
slip that heavy iron object from the bag to a
hiding place under his coat. &#8220;How on earth
do you happen to have that thing with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have been a private tip from the
skies,&#8221; grinned Hank, &#8220;but I saw the thing
lying in the motor room and I picked it up and
slipped it into this satchel. Take the bag from
me and I&#8217;ll get out on the porch.&#8221;</p>
<p>All this took place so quietly that the clerk
at the desk noticed nothing. Halstead now carried
the empty bag as he sauntered back to the
party. But he found chance to whisper to Joe:</p>
<p>&#8220;Anson Dalton must be in this hotel. Hank
is slipping out to watch the front of the house.
Hadn&#8217;t you better get around to the rear? If
it happens that the fellow is about to leave here,
it might be worth our while to know where he
goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nodding, Joe quietly slipped away. The
negro with the red bag had now entered the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
office. The bag, however, he took over to the
coat-room and left it there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Breakfast will be ready at any time after
eight o&#8217;clock, gentlemen,&#8221; announced the
clerk.</p>
<p>Powell Seaton lighted a cigar, remaining
standing by the desk. Tom stood close by. The
door of the office opened. Anson Dalton, puffing
at a cigarette, his gaze resting on the floor, entered.
He was some ten feet into the room before
he looked up, to encounter the steady gaze
of Captain Halstead and the charter-man.</p>
<p>Starting ever so little, paling just a bit, Dalton
returned that steady regard for a few seconds,
then looked away with affected carelessness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to leave us to-day, Mr. Dalton?&#8221; inquired
the clerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied the scoundrel, almost
sulkily. Then, lighting a fresh cigarette,
he strolled over by one of the windows. Presently,
without looking backward at the captain
and charter-man of the &#8220;Restless,&#8221; the fellow
opened a door and stepped out onto the porch.
There he promptly recognized Hank Butts, who
stared back at him with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if Lemly is with this fellow?&#8221;
whispered Halstead to his employer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going beyond that, and wondering what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
the whole fact of Dalton&#8217;s presence here can
possibly mean,&#8221; replied Powell Seaton.</p>
<p>The office door from the corridor opened
again. Through the doorway and across the
office floor stepped, with half-mincing gait, a
young, fair-haired man who, very plainly, had
devoted much attention to his attire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Mr. Dalton?&#8221; demanded this immaculate
youth, in a soft, rather effeminate
voice that made Halstead regard him with a
look of disfavor.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find him out on the porch, I think,
Mr. Dawley,&#8221; answered the clerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; replied the soft-voiced
one. As though he were walking on
eggs young Mr. Dawley turned, going toward
the porch door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, good morning, Dalton, dear fellow,&#8221;
cried the fair-haired dandy, in the same soft
voice, as he came upon Seaton&#8217;s enemy, who
was walking up and down the porch utterly
ignoring Hank Butts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Dawley,&#8221; replied Dalton,
looking more than a little bored by the interruption.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, who and what, in the game, is Dalton&#8217;s
Elizabeth-boy friend?&#8221; wondered Hank,
eying the latest arrival.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have a cigarette, Dawley?&#8221; asked Dalton,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
in a voice almost of irritation, as he held out
his case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Charming of you, indeed,&#8221; declared Dawley,
helping himself to a cigarette and lighting it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out the tobacco doesn&#8217;t make you sick,
babe,&#8221; muttered Hank Butts under his breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, my dear Dalton, about the business
we were discussing here last evening&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; began
the soft-voiced one, but the other broke in
on him with:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind, Dawley, I want to think
a bit now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that will be quite all right, I am sure,&#8221;
agreed the soft-voiced one. &#8220;Then I&#8217;ll just
stroll down the street a bit and be back in time
to breakfast with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dalton nodded and the fair-haired fashion
plate stepped down into the path and strolled
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of which tells us,&#8221; reflected Hank, &#8220;that
our friend Dalton has been here at least since
yesterday, and that he and the Elizabeth-boy
dude are not very well acquainted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Butts looked up, almost with a start, to find
Dalton close at hand, scowling into the boy&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re out here to watch me,&#8221;
growled Dalton, glaring.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I am, you wouldn&#8217;t expect me to grow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
confidential about it, would you?&#8221; asked Hank,
grinning into the other&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t want any of your impudence,&#8221;
snapped the rascal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t give you any, or anything else
belonging to me,&#8221; clicked Hank Butts, decisively.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re standing out here to watch me,&#8221;
continued Dalton, &#8220;I am willing to tell you that
I am not leaving the hotel for the present.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That, or any other information you are
willing to offer me, will be treated in the utmost
confidence, I assure you,&#8221; promised Hank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too frolicsome with me!&#8221; warned
Dalton, wrathily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; echoed Hank, looking astonished.
&#8220;Why, I didn&#8217;t say anything until you spoke
to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a snort Anson Dalton strolled away to
a chair, seating himself and blowing out great
clouds of smoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t exactly glad to see us here&mdash;I can
guess that much,&#8221; thought Hank. &#8220;But I wish
I could guess how Anson Dalton comes to be
here. I didn&#8217;t see anything of his drab boat
in the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime Tom Halstead and Powell
Seaton, after dropping into chairs in the office,
were talking most earnestly in undertones.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
From where they sat they could see Dalton&#8217;s
red bag resting on a shelf in the coat-room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d give the world to know whether the rascal
has the stolen papers still in that bag!&#8221;
cried Seaton, anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would he be likely to leave the bag around
the hotel carelessly, if it contained anything so
important?&#8221; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;He might have been willing to do so before
he knew we were about here,&#8221; replied the
charter-man.</p>
<p>&#8220;But even when he knows we&#8217;re here the fellow
doesn&#8217;t seem anxious about the matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the clerk is behind the desk,
where he can see everything,&#8221; hinted Mr.
Seaton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet, for all Dalton knows, the clerk might
leave the room for a minute and give us our
chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve an idea,&#8221; muttered Mr. Seaton, rising
so quickly that Tom stood up with him. &#8220;You
keep the best eye possible over the rascal. Don&#8217;t
go in to breakfast unless he goes. Never mind
whether I come to breakfast or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, sir,&#8221; nodded Halstead.</p>
<p>As Powell Seaton crossed the porch without
even looking in Dalton&#8217;s direction, the young
motor boat captain also stepped outside, going
over to Hank.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Watch that fellow, Hank,&#8221; whispered Tom.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him get away from you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if I have to steal his cigarettes,&#8221; promised
Butts, with vim.</p>
<p>Then Skipper Tom vanished, though not for
long. He merely went to find Joe Dawson, at
the opposite side of the building. The two
chums returned together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Tom, in a chuckling whisper, &#8220;if
Anse Dalton wants to get away from us, he&#8217;ll
have to run in four different directions at the
same time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But did you see the nice plush boy that&#8217;s
with Dalton?&#8221; asked Hank, dryly. Butts, more
than any of the others of the party, had taken
a great dislike to the soft-voiced one.</p>
<p>Dalton turned, once in a while, to scowl in
the direction of the three motor boat boys.
That, however, was all the attention he gave
them. A little later Dawley returned and
seated himself beside his friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Breakfast is ready, gentlemen,&#8221; called the
clerk, opening the door.</p>
<p>Not one of the Motor Boat Club boys stirred
until after Dalton rose and stepped inside. Then
they followed, close in the rear.</p>
<p>Dalton and his companion stepped into the
dining room, installing themselves at a table
not far from the door. Tom led the way for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
his party at the second table beyond. Two
waiters appeared, one attending to each of the
tables.</p>
<p>Dawley was evidently in bubbling spirits.
He insisted on talking much, in his soft voice,
to Anson Dalton, who was plainly annoyed.
Tom Halstead glanced over at his enemy with
an amused smile.</p>
<p>Yet no word passed between the tables. Food
and coffee were brought, after some minutes,
and at both tables the meal was disposed of
slowly, excellent appetites being the rule.</p>
<p>Powell Seaton, in the meantime, had hastened
to the telegraph office. From there he
wired, &#8220;rush,&#8221; to the chief of police at Beaufort,
advising the latter that Anson Dalton was
in Mocalee, and asking whether Dalton was
wanted by the United States or state authorities
on any charges growing out of the seizure
of the schooner &#8220;Black Betty.&#8221;</p>
<p>This dispatch sent off, Mr. Seaton, though
remaining at the telegraph office, sent a messenger
in haste for James Hunter, who represented
Mocalee as chief of police and the entire
police force.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim Hunter,&#8221; as he was locally called, a
raw-boned, taciturn man, came speedily to the
telegraph office. He was in his shirt-sleeves,
chewing a straw, but he wore his police badge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
on his coat, while a short &#8220;billy&#8221; appeared in a
hip pocket. Jim Hunter listened quietly while
the operator, at Seaton&#8217;s request, displayed the
original of the telegram that had been sent to
Beaufort.</p>
<p>Telegraph companies give quick service on
telegrams relating to police business. So it was
not long ere the operator&#8217;s receiving instrument
began to click with the local call.</p>
<p>The first dispatch that the operator passed
out through the grated window was addressed
to Powell Seaton, and signed by the chief at
Beaufort. It read:</p>
<p style='font-size:0.9em; margin: 0.5em 2em'>
Thank you for information. Have wired chief of police,
Mocalee.</p>
<p>The second telegram, following almost instantly,
was addressed to the chief of police of
Mocalee. It ran:</p>
<p style='font-size:0.9em; margin: 0.5em 2em'>
Arrest Anson Dalton, wanted by U. S. authorities on
charge of smuggling. Powell Seaton will point him out to
you. Notify me when arrested. Be careful to get all Dalton
baggage. Hold for orders.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all I wanter know,&#8221; said Hunter,
laconically, biting off the end of his straw and
spitting it out. &#8220;Lead me to your friend Dalton,
Mr. Seaton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to warn you that he&#8217;s a desperate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
fellow,&#8221; murmured Mr. Seaton, as the pair left
the telegraph office together.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen that kind before,&#8221; nodded Mr.
Hunter, curtly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me, but I notice you carry a club.
Dalton will undoubtedly have a revolver, and
he&#8217;s likely to be ugly enough to attempt to use
it,&#8221; explained Mr. Seaton, apprehensively.
&#8220;May I ask if you have a pistol, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I always carry all the tools I need,&#8221; answered
Jim Hunter. &#8220;I don&#8217;t gen&#8217;rally &#8217;low
any man to pull a gun on me, though. Sometimes
I&#8217;m quicker&#8217;n I gen&#8217;rally look.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an air of quiet, forceful reserve
about this Florida policeman that made Powell
Seaton feel more confident that the business in
hand would not be defeated for lack of preparation.
They made their way quickly to the hotel.</p>
<p>Anson Dalton and his soft-voiced companion
were still at table, though evidently near the
end of their meal.</p>
<p>Hank Butts, at a signal from his captain, had
left the table. Hank had donned his rain-coat
again, and was now waiting in the corridor leading
to the stairs, in case Dalton should pass
that way.</p>
<p>A moment later Joe left the table, stepping
through the office and out onto the porch.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></div>

</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></div>
<p>Dalton and Dawley were just rising when
Halstead, seated where he could see out into the
office, saw Seaton and a stranger enter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, the music will begin,&#8221; thought Tom
Halstead, throbbing.</p>
<p>&#8220;There he is, officer&mdash;the dark one!&#8221; cried
Powell Seaton, leading the way into the dining
room.</p>
<p>Jim Hunter lost no time. He made a spring
in the direction of Anson Dalton, whose eyes
flashed fire. Trained in a hard, desperate
school, Dalton was fuller of tricks than the
police chief had expected.</p>
<p>As Hunter rushed at him, Dalton forcefully
pushed one of the small tables toward him. It
struck Hunter amidships, most unexpectedly,
and had the result of sending Mocalee&#8217;s police
force sprawling to the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t stop me&mdash;you shall not!&#8221; roared
Anson Dalton. He made a dash for the doorway
leading to the office. Swift as he was, Tom
Halstead darted through ahead of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll try to get that red bag&mdash;and he&#8217;ll put
up a fight with a pistol!&#8221; flashed through the
young motor boat skipper&#8217;s brain. &#8220;I&#8217;ll fool
him so far as the bag is concerned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Diving into the coat-room, the door of which
stood open, Halstead was in season to snatch
up the bag. He turned, to find Dalton rushing
at him, hands reached out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>Ducking under, Tom eluded Dalton, and
darted across the office.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let some of the others catch him,&#8221; gritted
Halstead, inwardly. &#8220;What we want most to
know may be in this bag!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was all done so quickly that Skipper Tom
was across the office, pulling open the door into
the corridor, before Anson Dalton bounded after
him.</p>
<p>Joe Dawson rushed in from the porch, but too
late to be of immediate help. Officer Hunter had
sprawled badly, and Mr. Seaton had halted to
aid him to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drop that bag, or you&#8217;ll wish you had&mdash;no
time for this nonsense,&#8221; blazed Dalton, angrily,
thrusting his right hand at his hip pocket.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>HANK BECOMES REALLY TERRIBLE</h3>
</div>
<p>Bump! Whack!</p>
<p>Tom Halstead tried to slam the door
shut in his pursuer&#8217;s face, but one of
Dalton&#8217;s feet barred the closing, then thrust the
door open.</p>
<p>As Halstead raced into the corridor Anson
Dalton was close behind him, his hand yanking
a revolver from his pocket.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>There would have been a shot in another
instant. Halstead might have been badly
hit.</p>
<p>But Hank Butts, on duty in the corridor, had
heard the cries.</p>
<p>As the door was thrust open Hank leaped forward.
Out from under his rain coat he brought
that same old hitching weight.</p>
<p>There was an instant, only, for action, but
young Butts was an expert with the weapon he
had made his own.</p>
<p>His hands flew aloft, then descended, just as
Anson Dalton&#8217;s left foot was thrust forward in
his running.</p>
<p>&#8220;Halt, you&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; roared Dalton.</p>
<p>Bim! Down came the hitching weight, and
landed squarely across the left foot of the pursuer.
Dalton let out a fearful yell, while his
revolver fell to the floor. There was a flash and
a crashing explosion in that confined space; the
weapon had been harmlessly discharged.</p>
<p>As for Dalton, he swayed dizzily for a few
seconds, trying to lift the injured foot. Then,
with a groan and a burst of ugly language, he
sank to the floor.</p>
<p>Hank darted in, securing his hitching weight
and backing off with it once more.</p>
<p>Though he had heard the discharge of the
pistol, Jim Hunter did not stop to reach for his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
own revolver. He leaped through into the corridor,
his pocket police club in hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;There he is, but you won&#8217;t have to club him
any,&#8221; announced Hank, dryly, pointing to the
groaning Dalton. &#8220;He&#8217;ll eat out of your hand,
now&mdash;will Anson Dalton.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pausing only to drop his club to the floor,
Jim Hunter whipped out a pair of handcuffs
from a cavernous pocket, bent over Dalton,
and&#8211;&#8211;</p>
<p>Snap-click! The troublesome enemy of the
motor boat boys was not only badly hurt, but a
secure prisoner as well.</p>
<p>Now, Seaton and the boys gathered about the
law&#8217;s captive.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;ll have to git up,&#8221; announced
Jim Hunter, putting a helping hand under one
of Dalton&#8217;s arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t&mdash;oh, stop! Let up! My foot&#8217;s
crushed. I can&#8217;t stand on it!&#8221; yelled Dalton.</p>
<p>Hunter came quickly to realize the fact that
Dalton could not stand with much comfort. Joe
came up with a chair, onto which the prisoner
was allowed to sink.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you boys think you&#8217;ve finished things
for me, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; leered Dalton, glaring
around him in a rage. &#8220;But you haven&#8217;t.
You&#8217;ll soon find that you&#8217;ve just begun to stir
up trouble for yourselves.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Go easy, man&mdash;do!&#8221; begged Hunter, soothingly.
&#8220;Of course yer pet corn feels bad just
now. But, say! That&#8217;s the niftiest way of stopping
a bad man, I reckon, thet was ever invented.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221; groaned Dalton. Then, catching the
trace of a smirk in Hank&#8217;s eyes, the rascal shook
his fist at the steward of the &#8220;Restless,&#8221; snarling:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll find my own way to settle with you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your time&mdash;when you&#8217;re feeling better,&#8221;
Hank begged, cheerfully.</p>
<p>Fair-haired, soft-voiced young Dawley had
followed the crowd out into the corridor. The
hotel clerk, the proprietor and three or four of
the servants all had increased the crowd there.
Dawley rapidly learned what had happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a beastly outrage,&#8221; he announced, his
soft voice sounding almost harsh in the indignation
that he felt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, take a fan, Dolly, and go out on the
porch to cool off,&#8221; growled Joe Dawson.</p>
<p>One of the servants, in the excess of excitement,
actually took the fair-haired youth by the
shoulders, and, though the latter protested,
thrust him out through the open door onto the
porch, slamming the door after him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; grinned Hank. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go
out and see if the poor fellow has fainted.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>As Butts stepped out on the porch, closing the
door shut after him, Dawley, his cheeks very
red, leaped out from the chair into which he
had sunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was you who played that mean trick on
my friend,&#8221; cried Dawley, in a voice which he
fondly believed trembled with rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted Hank, meekly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll punish you for that!&#8221; quivered the soft-voiced
one, stepping forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t strike me on the wrist,&#8221; pleaded
Hank. &#8220;I have rheumatism there.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Dawley, too angry, or else too dull to
understand that he was being made a mark
for ridicule, continued to advance upon Butts,
who retreated, a look of mock alarm in his
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep away from me&mdash;please do, while
you&#8217;re angry,&#8221; begged Hank, still retreating.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t!&#8221; snapped Dawley. As Hank now
retreated rapidly backward, Dawley went after
him with corresponding speed.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you must have it, then, why&mdash;take it!&#8221;
cried Hank, in a tone of desperation.</p>
<p>One of his hands had been held under his
rain-coat all along. Now Hank thrust the other
hand inside, as well, to reach for some object
concealed there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh. O-o-oh! Don&#8217;t you drop that weight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
on my foot!&#8221; yelled Dawley, blanching and falling
up against the wooden wall.</p>
<p>But Hank, ruthlessly, as one whose blood is
up, brought both his hands swiftly into view as
he sprang at Dawley. There was a yell from the
fair-haired one as Hank bent forward, then
dropped squarely on the toes of Dawley&#8217;s right
foot&mdash;his <i>pocket-handkerchief</i>!</p>
<p>&#8220;There, now!&#8221; mimicked Hank Butts, turning
on his heel.</p>
<p>A roar of laughter came from Mr. Seaton,
Tom, Joe and two or three of the bystanders
who had followed outside.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, young man,&#8221; said Powell Seaton,
resting a hand on Dawley&#8217;s collar, &#8220;but
the chief of police wants to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not arrested, am I?&#8221; demanded the soft-voiced
one, in a tone of great alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not. But come along. The chief
wants to see you in the office.&#8221;</p>
<p>There they found Hunter and his manacled
prisoner, who had been carried into the office
just as he sat on the chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s that red bag that started all the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
trouble?&#8221; demanded Chief Hunter. Joe Dawson
produced it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t open that,&#8221; leered Dalton, though
he spoke uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can&#8217;t unlock it, we&#8217;ll cut it open with
a sharp breadknife,&#8221; mocked Hunter. &#8220;Yet I
reckon thet we&#8217;ll find the key in yer pocket.&#8221;</p>
<p>This guess turned out to be correct. The key
was inserted in the lock and the bag opened.
Powell Seaton pushed forward to help the police
official in the inspection of the contents.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are my papers,&#8221; cried Powell Seaton,
grabbing at two envelopes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look &#8217;em over, ef you want, but I reckon
I&#8217;ll haveter have &#8217;em to go with the prisoner,&#8221;
assented Chief Hunter.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re the same papers that this fellow
stole&mdash;one set from Clodis, and the other from
my bungalow through a helper,&#8221; cried Mr.
Seaton.</p>
<p>Anson Dalton watched Seaton with a strange,
sinister look.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gracious! Look at these, here!&#8221; gasped
Chief Hunter, opening a small leather case.
Nearly a score of flashing white stones greeted
his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Di&#8217;munds, I reckon,&#8221; guessed the police
chief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; Brazilian diamonds,&#8221; confirmed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
Powell Seaton. &#8220;Probably this prisoner&#8217;s
share or proceeds from smuggling in diamonds.
That business, then, was what the &#8216;Black Betty&#8217;
was used for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those are the diamonds I came down here
to negotiate for,&#8221; broke in Dawley, wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; demanded Hunter, surveying the
soft-voiced one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; my father is Dawley, the big jeweler
at Jacksonville,&#8221; explained the youth. &#8220;Here&#8217;s
his card. I&#8217;m the buyer for the house, and your
prisoner wrote that he had some fine stones to
sell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re fine, all right, or I&#8217;m no judge of
Brazilian diamonds,&#8221; nodded Powell Seaton.
&#8220;But I guess the United States Government
owns them, now, as a confiscated prize.&#8221;</p>
<p>A carriage was brought around to the door,
and Anson Dalton was driven to the county jail,
eight miles away, to be locked up there pending
the arrival of United States officers.</p>
<p>Dawley easily proved his innocence, and the
truth of his own story. Despite his effeminate
manners and soft voice, it afterwards developed
that the youth was a skilled buyer of precious
stones, and a young man of no little importance
in the business community of his home town.</p>
<p>Following the swift succession of events at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
the little Florida town, there came a lull in the
long strain of excitement and danger.</p>
<p>Every now and then Dick Davis and Ab Perkins,
aboard the Rio-bound &#8220;Glide,&#8221; found a
chance to have a wireless message relayed back
to the United States.</p>
<p>These messages came in veiled language, according
to instructions, but they conveyed to
Powell Seaton the joyous news that these two
far-away members of the Motor Boat Club were
proceeding safely on their long journey, and
that no harm was happening to them, nor to the
precious papers in their care.</p>
<p>One fine day a cablegram came all the way
from Rio Janeiro which told that Dick and Ab
had reached that Brazilian city, and had turned
over the papers in their care to the waiting
American for whom they were intended.</p>
<p>A week after that came another cablegram,
announcing that the American syndicate had
succeeding in locating the lost diamond field,
and that papers for a proper patent were being
filed with the Brazilian Government.</p>
<p>Right on top of that came the news, in the
daily press, that Governor Terrero, of Vahia,
had been shot and killed by an escaped prisoner&mdash;a
former enemy whom the governor had
greatly and wickedly harassed.</p>
<p>Captain Dave Lemly was captured about this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
time. He and Dalton, it developed, had been
the principal American agents in a big scheme
for smuggling Brazilian diamonds into the
United States. The gems, it was shown, were
secretly shipped in quantities from Rio, aboard
a sailing ship. This ship, carrying a general
cargo, was always met near Beaufort by Lemly,
in the &#8220;Black Betty,&#8221; and the diamonds were
taken on the little black schooner. As the
&#8220;Black Betty&#8221; sailed as a fishing boat, Dave
Lemly had always been able to evade the American
customs authorities, and a hugely profitable
business in diamond smuggling had been
built up.</p>
<p>Governor Terrero, of the state of Vahia,
Brazil, it is supposed, was behind the southern
end of the smuggling scheme, though this has
not been proved. Dalton, acting as the governor&#8217;s
go-between and spy, had played his part
well and desperately. Yet now, in the end, Dalton
was convicted on the evidence furnished by
some of the members of the late crew of the
&#8220;Black Betty.&#8221; So was Lemly, and both are
now serving long sentences in prison, along with
the members of the crew of the smuggling
schooner.</p>
<p>Clodis recovered, after a few weeks. He was
handsomely rewarded by the new diamond syndicate
for the dangers through which he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
run. He last remembered descending the stairs
to the &#8220;Constant&#8217;s&#8221; stairs, and had no recollection
of having been struck down.</p>
<p>All the members of the guard over at Lonely
Island were more than handsomely paid. Even
Jasper was forgiven, and well rewarded.</p>
<p>After he had been in prison some length of
time Anson Dalton one day confessed to Mr.
Seaton&#8217;s attorney that, while at sea on the drab
boat (which was afterwards found and confiscated
by the revenue people), he, Dalton, had
copied the stolen papers, intending to send one
set southward and retain the originals.</p>
<p>After losing both the &#8220;Restless&#8221; and the
&#8220;Glide&#8221; in the fog, Dalton had had Lemly put
in to shore. There they had been met by a
trusted Brazilian spy for Governor Terrero.
The Brazilian, with the copies of the papers,
had hurried to New York by train. This Brazilian
did not succeed in starting for Rio until
some days after the &#8220;Glide&#8221; had sailed, and,
moreover, he went on a slower boat. So, by
the time the Brazilian spy arrived at Rio, the
American syndicate had located the lost diamond
field, had filed patents with the Government,
and Terrero had died. So all of Anson
Dalton&#8217;s plotting had come to naught.</p>
<p>One of Powell Seaton&#8217;s first acts was to adjust
fully the claim of the Havana line for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
towing of the &#8220;Restless&#8221; through that fearful
northeast gale.</p>
<p>While waiting for the final news of the success
of his plans, the charter-man cruised much
up and down the coast with the boys of the
&#8220;Restless.&#8221; Then afterwards, through the
month of November, Seaton enjoyed another
cruise with them.</p>
<p>The charter money was not all that Captain
Tom, Engineer Joe and Steward Hank received
for their splendid work.</p>
<p>As soon as the final plans of the great new
American diamond syndicate at Rio Janeiro had
been established on a safe and firm basis, the
charter-man of the &#8220;Restless&#8221; was prepared to
talk of a splendid reward. His plans were so
big, in fact, that all three of the boys felt bound
to call a halt. Yet the reward that they <i>did</i>
finally accept made very important additions
to the bank accounts of all three of these daring
young motor boat navigators.</p>
<p>Dick Davis and Ab Perkins, on their return
from Rio, were &#8220;remembered&#8221; by Mr. Seaton
with bank drafts the size of which almost took
away their breath.</p>
<p>Then came a new cruise, a new set of adventures
in new surroundings. It was a cruise
which the many friends of our Motor Boat Club
boys will agree was the most wonderful, the most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
exciting, and certainly the most mysterious lot
of adventures through which any member of
the Club ever passed. The details of what happened,
however, must be reserved for the next
volume in this series, which will be published
under the title: &#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>The Motor Boat Club in
Florida</span>; Or, Laying the Ghost of Alligator
Swamp.&#8221;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
